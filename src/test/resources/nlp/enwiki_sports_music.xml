A '''tombeau''' (plural '''tombeaux''') is a musical composition (earlier, in the early 16th century, a poem) commemorating the death of a notable individual. The term derives from the French word for &quot;tomb&quot; or &quot;tombstone&quot;. The vast majority of tombeaux date from the 17th century and were composed for [[lute]] or other plucked string instruments. The genre gradually fell out of use during the 18th century, but reappeared in the early 20th.

==History==
&quot;In instrumental music, ''tombeau'' signifies a musical 'tombstone' (French ''le tombeau'' = tomb). The musical genre of tombeau is generally connected with music for the [[lute]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Of some 60+ surviving pieces, most are intended for the [[lute]] or [[theorbo]], 5 for the baroque [[guitar]], 7 for the [[viola da gamba]] and 3 for [[harpsichord]]. The earliest example of this genre seems to be the ''Tombeau de [[Ren√© Mezangeau|Mezangeau]]'' (1638) by French lutenist [[Ennemond Gaultier]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Musical predecessors are memorial pavans like those by [[Anthony Holborne]] (''Countess of Pembrokes Funeralle'', 1599). In France, where this musical genre emerged first, strong influence of literary models, particularly of memorial poems that were popular from the 16th to the end of the 17th centuries, may have been another important factor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The tombeau preeminently comes in two forms, as a slow elegiac [[allemande]] grave in 4/4 or as a [[pavane|pavan]], a tri-partite [[renaissance dance]] already long out of date for the era of tombeaux, but with all the trappings of the allemande (cf. [[Denis Gaultier]], ''Tombeau pour M. [[Racquette]]''). There are also a few unique tombeaux that appear as [[gigue]]s; that is because the gigue grave resembles the allemande in a number of respects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;As opposed to the Italian [[lamento]], the tombeau should not have used expressive elements of mourning, which were skeptically viewed in France. Nevertheless, certain typical [[onomatopoetic]] features were used: repeated note motifs depicting the knocking of Death at the door, ascending or descending [[diatonic]] or [[chromatic]] [[musical scale|scale]]s which depict the soul's tribulation and transcendence. Froberger's [[Lamentation]] on the Death of Ferdinand III or the Meditation sur ma Mort Future would be a prime example of such a form. Some tombeaux include a motif of four descending notes, a metaphor for grief given influential expression by John Dowland in his [[Lachrimae]] (1604). These genres offered many suitable expressive characteristics: the suspirans figure (a three-note upbeat), dotted rhythms, particularly in repeated notes, and slow-moving harmonies in the minor mode whose gravity is heightened by a tendency to settle on pedal points. Later examples also tend to use chromatic progressions related to the lamento bass. The few courante tombeaux exploit the same rhythmic features in triple metre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Developed by Parisian [[lutenist]]s ([[Denis Gaultier]], [[Charles Mouton]], [[Jacques Gallot]], [[Fran√ßois Dufault]]), the genre was soon taken over by [[clavecin]]ists ([[Johann Jakob Froberger]], [[Louis Couperin]], both on the death of their friend [[Charles Fleury|Blancrocher]] in 1652) and was then spread into Central Europe ([[Jan Anton√≠n Losy]], [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/tombeau&lt;/ref&gt;

The tombeau genre went into decline at the end of the 18th century.  It reappeared in the 20th century with [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Le tombeau de Couperin]]'' (1919).  Other 20th century tombeaux include [[Manuel de Falla]]'s ''Le tombeau de [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'' for solo guitar, [[Arthur Benjamin]]'s ''Le tombeau de Ravel'' for clarinet and piano, and the last movement of ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' by [[Pierre Boulez]]. In the 21st century a series of tombeaux was written by [[Roman Turovsky-Savchuk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sineris.es/tombeaux2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6327">'''Furniture music''', or in [[French (language)|French]] '''''musique d‚Äôameublement''''' (sometimes more literally translated as ''furnishing'' music), is [[background music]] originally played by live performers. The term was coined by [[Erik Satie]] in 1917.

==Satie's compositions==
===The music===
[[File:Satie Tapisserie en Fer forge 1924.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Furniture music: ¬´Tapisserie en Fer forg√©¬ª, 1924]]
Although other selections of Erik Satie's music can be experienced (and are sometimes indicated) as furniture music, Satie himself applied the name only to five short pieces, composed in three separate sets:
* 1st set (1917), for [[flute]], [[clarinet]] and [[string instrument|strings]], plus a trumpet for the first piece:
** 1. '''''Tapisserie en fer forg√©''''' - pour l'arriv√©e des invit√©s (grande r√©ception) - √Ä jouer dans un vestibule - Mouvement: ''Tr√®s riche'' (Tapestry in forged iron - for the arrival of the guests (grand reception) - to be played in a vestibule - Movement: Very rich)
** 2. '''''Carrelage phonique''''' - Peut se jouer √† un lunch ou √† un contrat de mariage - Mouvement: ''Ordinaire'' (Phonic tiling - Can be played during a lunch or civil marriage - Movement: Ordinary),
* 2nd set, '''''Sons industriels''''' (Industrial sounds, February/March 1920), for piano duet, 3 clarinets and [[trombone]]:
** Premier Entr'acte: '''''Chez un ‚ÄúBistrot‚Äù''''' (First Entr'acte: At a ‚Äú[[Bistro]]‚Äù)
** Second Entr'acte: '''''Un salon''''' (Second Entr'acte: A drawing room)
* 1923, commissioned by Mrs Eug√®ne Meyer jr. (living in Washington DC), for small orchestra:
** '''''Tenture de cabinet pr√©fectoral''''' (Wall-lining in a chief officer's office)

[[File:Satie Carrelage Phonique 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Furniture music: ¬´Carrelage Phonique¬ª, 1917]]
The first set was apparently never performed (nor the score published) during Satie's lifetime.

The second set contained reminiscences of popular tunes by, amongst others, [[Camille Saint-Sa√´ns]] and [[Ambroise Thomas]]. It was premiered in Paris the year it was composed, as [[intermission]] music to a lost [[List of comedies#Theatrical Comedies|comedy]] by [[Max Jacob]]. During these intermissions the audience was invited to visit an exposition of children's drawings in the [[Galerie Barbazanges]] that was hosting the premiere.

Indications of the intentions of the artists giving the first performance are found in the manuscript of the score:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Furnishing [[divertissement]] organised by the group of musicians known as the &quot;[[Les Six|Nouveaux Jeunes]]&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furnishing music replaces &quot;[[waltz]]es&quot; and &quot;[[opera]]tic [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]]&quot; etc. Don't be confused! ''It's something else!!!'' No more &quot;false music&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furnishing music completes one's property;
&lt;br /&gt;
it's new; it doesn't upset customs; it isn't tiring; it's [[France|French]]; it won't wear out; it ''isn't boring''
&lt;br /&gt;
''--quoted in [[Satie#Sources|Gillmor, 1988]], p 325-326''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See also [[Entr'acte]] article for more details regarding the circumstances of this first, and only documented, public performance of furniture music during Satie's lifetime, assisted by the composer himself.

The separate commissioned piece was sent to America. There are no known public performances or publications of this music prior to leaving the European continent. This piece is sometimes presented as ''furniture music No. 3''.

As Satie's pieces of furniture music were very short pieces, with an indefinite number of repeats, this kind of furniture music later became associated with [[repetitive music]] (sometimes used as a synonym of [[minimal music]]), but this kind of terminology did not yet exist in Satie's time.

===Publication===
For a quarter of a century after the composer's death, all of the furniture music pieces remained hidden from the general public, apart from being mentioned in early Satie biographies. By the end of the 1960s parts of the furniture music started to appear as [[facsimile]] illustrations to press articles and new Satie biographies. The first full publication of sets 1 and 3 followed in the early 1970s. There was no full publication of the 2nd set before the last years of the 20th century.

Several decades after Satie's death furniture music was revived, largely due to the American composer [[John Cage]], as the composer's theory of [[minimalism|minimalist]] background music. Furniture music appeared as the launchpad for minimalist/experimental/avant-garde music since it was the first instance of music being played or produced out of context: not as a centerpiece but as a cerebral backdrop.

These and other related ideas were picked up by several composers of the neo-Classical/20th Century school of music, accentuating atmosphere and texture over traditional form and movement. The minimalist references and anachronisms were not solidified until composer [[John Cage]] performed Satie's &quot;hidden&quot; piece ''[[Vexations]]'' 840 times as requested by Satie's own scribbled notes on the original sheet music.

'''''Famo''''' is a type of music from [[Lesotho]] in [[Africa]] consisting of singing accompanied by the [[accordion]], a drum and occasionally a [[bass (instrument)|bass]]. It originated in the drinking dens of migrant workers from Lesotho trying to relax after working in the mines in the 1920s but is now a popular form of music for [[Sesotho]] speakers.

Instrumental support comes from an accordion, a drum and a bass. Songs often refer to urban life, and female singers can use their singing to challenge their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;drumcafe&quot; /&gt;

==History==

The introduction of [[Basotho]] migrant labour from [[Lesotho]] into South African mines in the 1920s led to the development of ''famo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--pg155--&gt; It originated in the ''setolotolo'' bow songs that the menfolk would sing as they walked along, alternating between the bow to fill in the chorus and the voice as the lead part.&lt;ref name=&quot;drumcafe&quot; /&gt; With the introduction of European instruments, the ''korosetina'' ([[concertina]]) and ''koriana'' ([[accordion]])&lt;!--EDITOR NOTE:purposefully linked again here to allow the user to compare--&gt; were adopted. The concertina was initially favoured as it could be played whilst singing
and was easily carried but the accordion was eventually favoured for its bigger sound which was better for dancing.&lt;ref name=&quot;drumcafe&quot; /&gt;

The music and singing combination of ''famo'' was performed in the [[shebeen]]s where the workers drank and chatted and also down in the mines whilst they toiled.&lt;ref name=&quot;drumcafe&quot; /&gt; The name ''famo'' came from the phrase ''ho re famo'', to flare the nostrils or to throw up one's garments.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt; The dancing girls who had followed the men to South Africa and entertained them in the shebeens perfected a dance with their short skirts that allowed them to artfully flick up the skirt, exposing their naked rear.&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt; The performers were careful not to wear underwear.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt;

In 1963 reforms to South African regulations meant the repatriation of thousands of women and famo performers and shebeen danceers were forced back to Lesotho.&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt; This encouraged the creation of ensembles that were rounded out by a drummer. The ''moropa'' drum they used was a 20-litre tar can topped by a piece of [[Tire#Inner tube|inner tube]] as the [[drumhead]], with ''manyenenyene'', metal bottle tops or jangles, to provide a jingling alternative to the thump of the drum.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt; The drumsticks themselves were made from slices of tire.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt;

Since the 1920s music companies had been looking for African music they could commercialise.&lt;ref name=&quot;coplan&quot; /&gt; What turned the music of the shebeens into a national music for the Basotho was the rise of major recording personalities amongst the ''famo'' ensembles.&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt;

==Artists==
In the late 1960s the first major recording artists to make a living from ''famo'' were ''Tau ea Mat≈°ekha'' (Lion of Mat≈°ekha, Mat≈°ekheng/Habo Mat≈°ekha is an area in Northern Lesotho) made up of Forere Motloheloa (accordionist) and Apollo Ntabanyane (vocalist/composer).&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot; /&gt; The pair met and honed their musical act in the mines and shebeens but their success with albums such as ''Peete Kea Falla'' (Peete's Place I'm Quitting) released by [[EMI]] led Ntabanyane to leave and set up his own group. in 1974 he even  declared himself &quot;King of Famo&quot; at a concert at [[Maseru]]'s Airport Hotel that was attended by Her Majesty 'MaMohato, wife of Lesotho's King Moshoeshoe II.&lt;ref name=&quot;rca&quot;&gt;{{cite book

{{Russian music}}
'''VIA''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''–í–ò–ê'') is an abbreviation for Vocal-[Music] Instrumental-Ensemble ({{lang-ru|–í–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-–∏–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞–Ω—Å–∞–º–±–ª—å}}, ''Vokalno-instrumentalny ansambl''). It is the general name used for [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands that were formally recognized by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government from the 1960s to the 1980s. 

In Soviet times, the term ''VIA'' generally meant ''band'', but it is now used in Russia to refer specifically to pop, rock, and folk groups active during the Soviet period.

==History==
The term VIA appeared in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and represented a model under which the Soviet government was willing to permit domestic rock and pop music acts to develop. To break through to the state-owned Soviet media, a band needed to become an officially-recognized VIA. Each VIA had an artistic director (—Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å) who served as manager, producer, and state-appointed censor. In some bands (such as Pesniary) the artistic director was the band's leading member and songwriter, while in others he played the role of impresario.

Soviet VIAs played a specific style of pop music. They performed youth-oriented (but officially approved) radio-friendly music, which combined contemporary Western and Soviet trends. Folk instruments were often used, and occasionally a [[keytar]] (a keyboard held like a guitar). Songs varied from pop ballads, dance-beat disco and new wave to mainstream rock (although bands avoided the &quot;rock music&quot; label until the late 1970s, because rock was considered &quot;bourgeois&quot; and formally banned). Many VIAs had up to ten members (including a number of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists), who were in frequent rotation. 

Due to state censorship, the lyrics of VIAs were family-friendly; typical topics were universal emotions like love, joy, and nostalgia, or idealized vignettes from daily life. Many bands also encouraged national culture and patriotism, (especially those of national minorities from the smaller Soviet republics) such as [[Yalla (band)|Yalla]] from [[Uzbekistan]], Labyrinth from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Chervona Ruta (ensemble)|Chervona Ruta]] from [[Ukraine]]. Folk-based VIAs such as [[Pesniary]], Siabry and [[Verasy]] were especially popular in Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democraticbelarus.eu/node/3879 ‚ÄúPesnyary‚Äù ‚Äì Legends in Bell-Bottoms]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian bands from Moscow and Leningrad (such as [[Zemlyane]] and [[Tsvety]]) were more oriented towards Western pop and rock music.

Many VIAs were created by musicians that played together in local choruses or musical theatrical productions. The earliest VIAs included [[Avangard]] (Avantgarde) in 1964, [[Poyushchiye Gitary]] (Singing Guitars) in 1966, [[Vesyolye Rebyata]] (Jolly Fellows) in 1966, and Dobry Molodtsy (Good People) in 1969.

==Unique Characteristics==

The typical VIA consisted of 6 to 10 band members, with several singers and musicians capable of playing multiple instruments. Lead vocalists in VIAs usually did not play an instrument, but only sang. Virtually every member of a VIA was a professional musician with formal musical education and many years of performance experience.

The Soviet government had strict rules governing how members of a VIA were to behave on stage and conduct themselves in public. Performers were only allowed to wear suits, folks costumes, or military uniforms. Movement around the stage was discouraged. Musicians typically remained in one place as they played their instruments or sang. Anything outside of the conservative &quot;norm&quot;, such as long hair, tattoos, leather jackets, or metallic accessories were forbidden.

VIA song recordings were done by the State owned record company [[Melodiya]] (Melody). Concerts and performances were organized by professional associations such as Soyuzkontsert (Union Concerts), Moskontsert (Moscow Concerts), Lenkonsert (Leningrad Concerts), Roskontsert (Russian Concerts), and Goskontsert (Government Concerts), along with regional orchestra groups.

At times, a VIA would collaborate with a well-known solo singer to provide musical backing. Examples include [[Yuri Antonov (musician)|Yury Antonov]] and VIAs [[Araks]] and [[Aerobus]], [[Alla Pugacheva]] and VIA [[Retsital]], [[Sofia Rotaru]] and VIA [[Chervona Ruta]], [[Valeriy Obodzinskiy]] and VIA [[Verniye Druziya]], and [[Lev Leschenko]] and VIA [[Spektr]].

==Repertoire==
VIAs typically performed songs written by professional composers and lyricists who were members in good standing of the [[Union of Soviet Composers|Composers' Union]] and the [[Writers' Union of the U.S.S.R.|Writers' Union]] in the former Soviet Union. Some songs were created by VIA members or the VIA's artistic director. In the early 1980s, there was an unspoken rule that at least 80% of a VIA's performance repertoire had to be songs written by union members.

VIAs performed songs in a range of musical styles, including folk music, disco, rock, and synth-pop. Although tightly controlled by the government, VIAs had an enormous influence on the Russian public and created an audience for the rock music wave that followed. On the other hand, VIAs tended to deliver songs that were mainstream, simple in expression, and conservative in performance. Lyrics tended to focus on uncontroversial topics such as patriotic motifs, love stories, idealizations of work, light humor, ballads, current events, and folk themes. Any social criticism or protest was heavily censored and largely forbidden, except when directed against the West.

A number of VIAs did cover versions of foreign hits, typically changing the lyrics to entirely different meanings, but matching the music and vocalization. At times, VIAs went so far as to claim that the music was their own original work.

==Rise and Fall==
VIAs as a movement in Soviet music existed for approximately two decades, from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. They were very popular, particularly among Soviet youth. The best known VIAs would perform year round, giving several concerts a day. Many of these concerts received television and radio air time. Their albums sold tens of millions of copies. 

Most VIAs dissolved in the late 1980s. This was in part due to rock music becoming more popular and the censorship apparatus largely falling apart. The advent of synthesizers, samplers, and other technologies that enabled the creation of music without the use of a large number of musicians was also a contributing factor. Finally, the lyrical content of VIA songs became far less relevant in the new, more open society.

Although most VIAs disappeared, a number of VIA members enjoyed successful subsequent careers as solo performers or members of new bands. Many Russian pop and rock stars of the 1990s were VIA members in the 1970s and 1980s. A few of the most popular VIAs endured and continued to exist into the 1990s and thereafter, usually with a significantly different membership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1801">In music, '''eclecticism''' is the conscious use of styles alien to the [[composer]]'s own nature, or from a bygone era. The term is also used pejoratively to describe music whose composer, thought to be lacking originality, appears to have freely drawn on other models {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}. This word can also be used to describe the music of composers who combine multiple styles, such as using a whole-tone variant of a pentatonic folksong over chromatic counterpoint, or a tertian arpeggiating melody over quartal or secundal harmonies. Eclecticism can also be through quotations, whether of a style (e.g., [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpZtBNzVKQ Shostakovich: Symphony No. 9]),{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--What style is Shostakovich &quot;quoting&quot; in his Ninth Symphony?--&gt; direct quotations of folksongs/variations of them (e.g., Mahler: Symphony No. 1; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKd78WUa74 II] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQCHgnpCGf4 III]) or direct quotations of other composers (e.g., Berio: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YU-V2C4ryU Sinfonia; III]) {{harv|Cope|1997|loc=230‚Äì33}}.

{{commonscat|Traditional music}}
The term '''[[traditional music]]''' is often used as a broad classification of music genres that contrasts with '''[[classical music]]''' and '''[[popular music]]''' genres ''(see [[Musical genres]])'' as referring to genres founded neither upon any theoretical canon nor upon any mass commercial medium. The term has tended to replace '''[[folk music]]''', which has come to refer to European rural genres and contemporary American styles based upon these. The term '''[[ethnic music]]''', which gave rise to the discipline of [[ethnomusicology]], has also tended to give way to the term &quot;traditional&quot;. Nevertheless it can be difficult to draw clear lines even between these few terms.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Latham (ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, articles &quot;The Classical era&quot;, &quot;Folk music&quot; and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Indigenous music]]''' refers to the music of ethnic groups whose region has been occupied by later migrants: it has no strictly musical definition.

'''Posi Music''' (pronounced pah-zee) has been around since the 1940s,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} though only recently has a definitive label been applied to music in this [[genre]]. Short for Positive Music, Posi Music is categorized by its intention to have a positive effect on the listener. Musicians who write and perform Posi Music profess a desire for their music to unite and inspire their audience and make them feel better.
One of the earliest 100% Positive Songs was &quot;[[Accentuate The Positive]]&quot; written by [[Johnny Mercer]] and made famous by [[Bing Crosby]].   That same song also defined the concept that there is indeed polarity between being Positive or being Negative, specifically noting there is also no Neutral as in &quot;no more Mr. In-Between&quot;.

This concept has been expanded by groups promoting the education of Posi Music, such as the [http://positivemusicassociation.com Positive Music Association], [http://empowerma.com emPower Music and Arts] and the [http://positiveimperative.com/?page_id=20 Positive Music Imperative].  This concept of Positive Music and Negative music has also been identified in the book called [[A New Earth]], by [[Eckhart Tolle]]

[[File:PosiAwards2012.JPG|thumb|A sing-a-long at the 2012 Posi Awards in Orlando, Fl]]

== Origins ==

Early Posi Music certainly had some roots in traditional folk music, in the genre labeled protest music.  While much of protest music would not fit into the simple definition of Posi Music, a subjective opinion could easily include songs like  &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; by [[Pete Seeger]] or &quot;If I Had A Hammer&quot; performed by [[Peter Paul &amp; Mary]].

Deeper roots were nourished by [[New Thought]] musicians and Posi Music finally emerged as a fully defined concept when pioneers of the Posi Music genre, Karl Anthony, Shanti Norman, Charley Thweatt and Leroy White created music that was not focused on theology, but instead on more inclusive themes. Unlike [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[contemporary worship music]], Posi Music's lyrics are less specifically spiritual. By focusing on the human spirit and world community, Posi Music embraces musicians from any religion. As the genre has evolved, it has been adopted by artists following many different spiritual paths ranging from [[New Thought]], [[Agapism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christian Science]] and [[Catholicism]] to [[Buddhism]], [[Pantheism]] and [[Seicho-no-Ie]].

Increasingly, there are groups of Posi Music artists who are dedicating most, if not all, of their music specifically to uplifting or motivational topics. As favor for the genre has grown, entire record labels have been dedicated to publication of Posi Music.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As always, a selection of mainstream pop music would also fit into the genre of Posi Music, touching on major themes of Posi Music such as friendship and gratitude. Examples would be the hit songs &quot;[[You've Got A Friend]]&quot; by [[James Taylor]], &quot;[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]&quot; by [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], and &quot;[[Thank You For Being A Friend]]&quot; by [[Andrew Gold]]. Of course, countless others would fit the bill; gratitude songs could once again go all the way back to [[Bob Hope]]'s &quot;[[Thanks for the Memory]],&quot; right up to songs simply entitled &quot;Thank You&quot; by [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] or [[Natalie Merchant]].

== Style ==

Posi Music is described as being upbeat and uplifting music. Usually it centers around the [[lyrics]] rather than the music itself. Often it is affirmational, though sometimes it is a call directing the listener to make changes to how they live. Posi Music can be spiritual, but it is not specifically religious in nature. This is by design, as Posi Music is meant to be enjoyed by people of many faiths.

===Subjective Nature===

As music is an art, it will always be subjective in nature when it comes to the interpretation of what is and what isn't Posi Music.  While at either end of the spectrum it is easy to define a purely positive or negative song, some songs can be partially positive in focus but also include a love song element.  Indeed, one could argue that a pure love song like &quot;L O V E&quot; by Nat King Cole would fit, but others would suggest that too broad a concept.

== Uses ==
Posi Music can be used in many settings beyond spiritual communities. Posi Music is marketed for use in retreats, workshops, fitness centers, counseling centers, therapy, [[nursing home]]s and hospitals. The themes in Posi Music are ideal for programs such as Arts in Medicine, where music is used to promote [[healing]].

Uses of Posi Music have expanded to include motivational music for work-outs and companies like Amway have used motivational music to inspire their distributors.  Indeed even in 2008 [[Barack Obama]] used Posi Music in his Yes We Can campaign by enlisting artist support like [[India.Arie]] with songs like &quot;There's Hope&quot; and &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; by [[The Black Eyed Peas]].

== Events ==
[http://www.empowerma.com/Festival The Posi Music Festival] for 2016 will be February 11th-15th in Tampa Florida, culminating with emPower Music &amp; Arts'  [http://empowerma.com/posiawards Posi Awards], an award ceremony recognizing artists producing outstanding Posi Music from the previous year. Tickets to hear a collection of artists (Mega Concert) may be available to the public.

May 1 is [http://www.thelovefoundation.com/Global_Love_Day.htm Global Love Day], a celebration started by the Love Foundation. Posi Music plays a part as many Posi Musicians sponsor the event.

'''Humoresque''' (or Humoreske) is a genre of [[romantic music]] characterized by pieces with fanciful humor in the sense of mood rather than wit.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Randel |first=Don Michael |authorlink=Don Michael Randel |title=The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians |year=1999 |publisher=Belknap [[Harvard University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=0-674-00978-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the German term ''Humoreske'', which was given from the 1800s (decade) onward to humorous tales.&lt;ref&gt;R. Grimm. &quot;Begriff und Gattung Humoreske&quot;. ''Jahrbuch der Jean Paul Gesellschaft'', 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable examples of the humoresque style are [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Humoreske (Schumann)|Humoreske]]'' in B-flat major ([[Opus number|Op.]]&amp;nbsp;20, 1839), and [[Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k|Dvo≈ô√°k]]'s [[Humoresques (Dvo≈ô√°k)|set of eight ''Humoresques'']] (Op.&amp;nbsp;101, 1894), of which No.&amp;nbsp;7 in G-flat major is well known.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot; /&gt;

==Definition==
This term is mostly used to refer to music descending from the tradition of Western [[classical music]]. This is the common definition referred by many musicologists and scholars, including [[Susan McClary]],&lt;ref&gt;Susan McClary,''Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality'', second edition, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991-2002): xv-xv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]],&lt;ref&gt;Kramer Lawrence, ''Musical Meaning: Toward a Critical History, Volume 1'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 81 &amp; 203.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]],&lt;ref&gt;For the use of the &quot;serious music&quot; term: Theodor Adorno, &quot;On the Social Situation of Music&quot; (1932), in Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie ''Essays on Music'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 395 ''et passim''. See also Theodor Adorno,&quot;On Popular Music&quot; (1941), in Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie ''Essays on Music'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 437-453 ''passim''. For the use of the &quot;art music&quot; term, see Theodor Adorno, &quot;On the Social Situation of Music&quot; (1932), in Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie ''Essays on Music'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 427 ''et passim''; see also Theodor Adorno, &quot; Alieneted Masterpiece: Missa Solemnis&quot; (1959), in Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie ''Essays on Music'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 665. Both terms (&quot;art music&quot;/&quot;serious music&quot;) are dealt as equivalents in the context of the book and this is reflected in the index of the book: the &quot;art music&quot; entry is reported on the &quot;Serious Music&quot; entry of the index (cf. Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie ''Essays on Music'' (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002), 717).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deryck Cooke]],&lt;ref&gt;Deryck Cooke, ''The Language of Music'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001): 53 and 96 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Swain (musicologist)|Joseph Swain]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Swain, Musical Languages (new York and London: Norton and Company, 1997): 124 and passim&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Cook]], [[Nicola Dibben]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook and Nicola Dibben, &quot;Musicological Approaches to Emotion&quot;, in ''Music and Emotion: Theory and Research'', 45‚Äì70 (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001): 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Tagg]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, &quot;Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice&quot;, ''Popular Music'' 2, 37-67 (1982): 39-42 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and Gregory Booth and Terry Lee Kuhn.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Booth and Terry Lee Kuhn, &quot;Economic and Transmission Factors as Essential Elements in the Definition of Folk, Art, and Pop Music&quot;, ''The Musical Quarterly'' 74, no. 3 (1990):411‚Äì38. Citation on 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these authors, however, tend to be critical or prudent with respect to certain implications of this classification. Those authors most particularly associated with [[New musicology|critical musicology]] movement and popular music studies like Tagg tend to reject latent social elitism that has sometimes been associated with this classification.

Some other authors interested in music theory may define art music differently. Musician [[Catherine Schmidt-Jones]] for example defines art music as &quot;a music which requires significantly more work by the listener to fully appreciate than is typical of popular music.&quot; In her view, &quot;[t]his can include the more challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Schmidt-Jones, &quot;[http://cnx.org/content/m11421/latest/ What Kind of Music Is That?]&quot;, from the website Connexions, last edited by Catherine Schmidt-Jones on 10 January 2007 8:58 am US/Central, retrieved on 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While often used to refer primarily to [[European classical music|Western historical classical music]], the term may refer to:
* The [[List of classical and art music traditions|classical/art music traditions]] of several different cultures around the world;
* [[Modernism (music)|Modern]] and [[contemporary classical music]], including [[serialism]], [[electronic art music]], [[Experimental Music|experimental (art) music]] and [[minimalist music]], as well as other forms;
* Some forms of [[jazz]], excluding most forms generally considered popular music. Jazz is generally considered popular music. ([[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] for example refers to jazz as some kind of popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, &quot;On Popular Music&quot;, in ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science'', 17-48 (New York: Institute of Social Research, 1941): IX.{{Full|date=June 2011}}&lt;!--Assuming this is a collection of essays by different authors, the editor should be named; if it is a journal, the volume and issue numbers are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) But some more technical forms of jazz have blurred borders between art music and popular music.
* Music that is highly formalized, that is, in which all or most musical elements are specified in advance, usually in written notation, as opposed to being improvised or otherwise left up to the performer's discretion.

While earlier musicological approaches tended to consider art music in an elitist way, asserting the superiority of art music over other forms of music (for example [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Gracyk, &quot;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/music-po.htm#H2 The Aesthetics of Popular Music]&quot;, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (accessed 13 June 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;), many modern musicologists (most particularly ethnomusicologists) dispute the notion of superiority. In a recent international musicology colloquium dedicated to music and globalization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://recherche.univ-montp3.fr/rirra21//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=112 Colloquium &quot;Musique et globalisation&quot;]{{Full|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some ethnomusicologists such as Jean During insisted that no matter the technicity and difficulty of music, every musical tradition has the same dignity and no one can claim any superiority over another.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion during Fran√ßois-Bernard M√¢che's conference: ¬´Musique au singulier¬ª [http://recherche.univ-montp3.fr/rirra21//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=112 Colloquium &quot;Musique et globalisation&quot;]{{Full|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many art music composers have made reference to popular music including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Vincent D‚ÄôIndy]], [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Manuel Ponce (composer)|Manuel M. Ponce]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[William Walton]], while others like [[B√©la Bart√≥k]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[John Cage]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k]], [[Lou Harrison]],  [[Zolt√°n Kod√°ly]], [[Fran√ßois-Bernard M√¢che]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Claude Vivier]] have drawn influence from regional or extra-European [[traditional music]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=Two claims involving numerous people and numerous unstated locations and genres}}

Moreover, in some cases the distinction between popular and art music has been blurred, particularly in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis 1983 p. 111&quot;/&gt;

==Characteristics==
The term primarily refers to classical traditions (including contemporary as well as historical classical music forms) that focus on formal styles, invite technical and detailed deconstruction&lt;ref name=&quot;Siron p. 242&quot;/&gt; and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In strict western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis 1983 p. 111&quot;/&gt; preserved in some form of [[Musical notation|music notation]], as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings (like [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis 1983 p. 111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, &quot;Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice&quot;, Popular Music 2 (1982): 37-67, here 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe beginning prior to the Renaissance period and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period.  The identity of a &quot;work&quot; or &quot;piece&quot; of art music is usually defined by the notated version, rather than a particular performance of it (as for example with classical music).

However, other cultural classical traditions may refer to oral transmission. Treatises on the structural and theoretical considerations underlying Indian classical music have been available for millennia, notably the [[Natyashastra]] of Bharata, dated to between 200 BC and 200 AD. Some Western classical composers, notably [[Messiaen]], relied on Indian rhythmic frameworks for their rhythmically more sophisticated compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Mirjana ≈†imund≈æa,&quot;Messiaen's Rhythmical Organisation and Classical Indian Theory of Rhythm (I)&quot;, ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'' 18, no.1 (1987): 117‚Äì44, here 117 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some western modern or experimental forms, the written notation of art music may depart from standard musical notation and use a variety of new types of notation to facilitate the exploratory nature of these new forms of music. In other words, while the notation may not be formal or traditional, there remains an element of formality or intellectual discipline to the construction and communication of the content of the work.

Although the term &quot;[[:classical music]]&quot; is commonly used in the West to refer to '''[[:Western culture|Western]]''' or '''[[:Europe|European]] classical music''', other forms of ''classical music'' have been developed by non-Western [[culture]]s and [[:civilization]]s.

[[Image:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Shepherdess (1889).jpg|thumb|''[[The Shepherdess (1889)|The Shepherdess]]'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]], 1889]]

An '''idyll''' or '''idyl''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|a…™|d|…ôl}} or {{IPAc-en|Àà|…™|d|…ôl}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Œµ·º∞Œ¥œçŒªŒªŒπŒøŒΩ}}, ''eidullion'', &quot;short poem&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dei%29du%2Fllion Œµ·º∞Œ¥œçŒªŒªŒπŒøŒΩ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is a short [[poem]], descriptive of rustic life, written in the style of [[Theocritus]]' short [[pastoral]] poems, the ''Idylls''. 

Unlike [[Homer]], Theocritus did not engage in heroes and warfare. His idylls are limited to a small intimate world, and describe scenes from everyday life. Later imitators include the Roman poets [[Virgil]] and [[Catullus]], Italian poets [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Sannazaro]] and [[Leopardi]], and the English poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (''[[Idylls of the King]]''). [[Goethe]] called his poem ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'' ‚Äî which [[Schiller]] considered the very climax in Goethe's production ‚Äî an idyll.&lt;ref&gt;Gjert Vestrheim: &quot;Hellas som ideal&quot;, ''Antikken i ettertiden'' (s. 170-2), edited by Universitetsforlaget, Oslo 2009, ISBN 978-82-15-01482-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term is used in music to refer generally to a work evocative of pastoral or rural life such as [[Edward MacDowell]]'s ''Forest Idylls'', and more specifically to a kind of French courtly entertainment (''[[divertissement]]'') of the [[Baroque music|baroque era]] where a pastoral poem was set to music, accompanied by ballet and singing. Examples of the latter are [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s ''L'Idylle sur la Paix'' set to a text by [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Henri Desmarets|Desmarets]]' ''Idylle sur la naissance du duc de Bourgogne'' set to a text by [[Antoinette Deshouli√®res]].&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael (1999). &quot;Idyll&quot;, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7iuZ6HaEMmoC&amp;q=Idyll#v=snippet&amp;q=Idyll&amp;f=false ''The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians'']. Harvard University Press, p. 312 and ''[[passim]]''. ISBN 0-674-00084-6; Sadie, Julie Anne (1998). ''Companion to Baroque Music''. University of California Press, p. 53. ISBN 0-520-21414-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, an idyll is a painting depicting the same sort of subject matter to be found in idyllic poetry, often with rural or peasant life as its central theme. One of the earliest examples is the early 15th century ''[[Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer (2002) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e2DvEibWkKsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=idyll+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gs9OTZGtF4mChQex3OiVDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=idyll%20painting&amp;f=false ''What Great Paintings Say'', Volume 1]. Taschen, p.20. ISBN 3-8228-2100-4&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was particularly popular in English paintings of the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Treble, Rosemary (1989). &quot;The Victorian picture of the country&quot; in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7P8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=idyll+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=astOTdreC6OqhAfQxKWoDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw# ''The Rural idyll''] (G.

'''World music''' is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many [[music genre|genres]] including some forms of Western music represented by folk music, as well as selected forms of ethnic music, [[traditional music]], [[indigenous music]], neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as when ethnic music and Western [[popular music]] intermingle. 

World music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose for some obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in ''[[Roots]]'' magazine's description of the genre as &quot;local music from out there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Nickson. ''The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to World Music''. Grand Central Press, 2004.  pp 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467‚Äì488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Globalization]] has facilitated the expansion of world music's audiences and scope.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as world fusion, global fusion, ethnic fusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/ethnic-fusion-d224 |title=Ethnic fusion Music |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[worldbeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/worldbeat-d248 |title=Worldbeat |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/world_fusion_800/en_US#contents_top |title=World Fusion Music |publisher=worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been credited to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Robert E.

|title=What Is World Music? |publisher=people.iup.edu |date=December 1994 |accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of &quot;all the music in the world&quot;, though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Bohlman, Philip (2002). ''World Music: A Very Short Introduction'', &quot;Preface&quot;. ISBN 0-19-285429-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nidel 2004, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines [[Western world|Western]] popular music styles with one of many [[music genre|genres]] of non-Western music that are also described as [[folk music]] or [[ethnic music]]. However, world music is not exclusively traditional folk music. It may include cutting edge [[pop music]] styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as &quot;local music from out there&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''[[fRoots]]'' magazine, quoted in N'Dour 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;someone else's local music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Songlines]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture, including Western elements (examples noted in this section).

World music may incorporate distinctive non-Western [[musical scale|scales]], [[musical mode|modes]] and/or musical [[Inflection (music)|inflections]], and often features distinctive traditional [[ethnic instrument]]s, such as the [[kora (instrument)|kora]] (West African [[harp]]), the [[steel drum]], the [[sitar]] or the [[didgeridoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GESNLHsUzDk&amp;list=PLcpIAFes_O8tlwlWiAiySStan1b9D3sx6&amp;index=21 Skyphos Songs] by [[Elena Frolova]] on poetry by [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] using reconstructed ancient angular harp found in [[Altai mountains]] in Siberia&lt;/ref&gt;

Music from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another, and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself. Academic study of world music, as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[performance studies]] and [[ethnomusicology]].

Dr. Jonathan Overby, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Edgewood College, holds as many scholars do, that all music fits under the categorical umbrella labeled ‚Äúworld music‚Äù.  A more common notion suggests that world music is the expression of a culture‚Äôs traditional roots music, indigenous music, or folk music.  Additionally, there are those who believe that world music is authored, created and originally played, interpreted, performed and composed by indigenous musicians within the communities uniquely related to the music and the region of origin where the music was first birthed.

This in part, also remains a troublesome idea to Overby, because it &quot;suggests that if you are not originally born into, steeped in, from or deeply linked to the culture of a particular group‚Äôs music, one cannot legitimately create, perform or assign terminology to another groups music creations.

===Evolving terminology===
[[File:Anda Union-1.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Anda Union at a music festival]]
In the age of [[digital music|digital music production]] the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music [[music sampling|samples]], [[sound bites]] and [[music loops|loops]] from every known region are commonly used in [[pop music|commercial]] [[music production]], which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, [[independent music|independent artists]]. These influences proliferate quickly in a web-based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger, predominantly self-promoted menu, via an increasing number of [[independent music|indie-artist]]-friendly, [[music streaming|streaming]] [[Internet]] options, such as [[Last.fm]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], [[Live365]], Jango Artist Airplay and [[ReverbNation.com|ReverbNation]].

An amalgamation of [[Folk music|roots music]] in the global, [[contemporary music|contemporary]] listening palette has become apparent, which weakens the role major entertainment labels can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries. As a result, definitions of the genre have become particularly varied, and determined by particularly wide-ranging and varied opinions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Similar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as world, rock and pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. This is especially true in the context of world music, where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and [[blogging]], global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate [[marketing]] forums and music [[journalism]]. The world music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of [[Folk music|roots music]] traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a [[globalization|globalizing]] [[pop culture]].

The classic, original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture, and the [[debate|modern debate]] over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibetrans.com/trans/a300/new-perspectives-in-ethnomusicology-a-critical-survey |title=New Perspectives in Ethnomusicology: A Critical Survey |publisher=Society of Ethnomusicology |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A2526815 |title=Origins of World Music |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report on the 2014 ''globalFEST'' National Public Radio's Anastasia Tsioulcas said  &quot;Even within the &quot;world music&quot; community, nobody likes the term &quot;world music.&quot; It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues, from cultural colonialism to questions about what's &quot;authentic&quot; and what isn't (and who might get to police such inquiries), and forces an incredible array of styles that don't have anything in common under the label of &quot;exotic Other.&quot; What's more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, &quot;world music&quot; means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion. It's a problematic, horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one.&quot;&lt;ref name = GF2014&gt;http://www.npr.org/2014/01/16/263081652/what-makes-globalfest-so-interesting  ''What Makes globalFEST So Interesting''  1/16/14 by Anastasia Tsioulcas Retrieved 1/16/14&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, other Welsh-language bands such as [[Calan (band)|Calan]] and [[9 Bach]] have achieved international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkwales.org.uk/Magazine/Sept%202013/Calan.html folkwales.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/08/9bach-tincian-review The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental [[psychedelic rock]] group [[Super Furry Animals]]'s Welsh-language album ''[[Mwng]]'' was released in May 2000 and re-released in May 2015, captures the spirit of World music as 'trying to hang on to something that's under serious threat from advanced capitalism'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/super-furry-animals/pages/mwng.shtml BBC Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots.  Over the 20th century, the invention of [[sound recording]], low-cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called &quot;[[crossover (music)|crossover]]&quot; music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Hybrid examples==
[[File:Vampire Weekend Red Rocks 05.20.13.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Vampire Weekend]] performing at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in 2013]]
Since the music industry established this term, the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as &quot;world&quot; music in today's market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition, style and interpretation,&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;/&gt; and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids, such as World fusion, Global fusion, Ethnic fusion or [[Worldbeat]]. Good examples of hybrid, world fusion are the [[Irish folk music|Irish]] / [[West African music|West African]] meld of [[Afro Celt Sound System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/afro-celt-sound-system-p200387 |title=Afro Celt Sound System |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pan-cultural sound of [[Aomusic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/aomusic-p2335411 |title=Aomusic |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[jazz]] / [[Finnish folk music|Finnish folk]] music of [[V√§rttin√§]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vrttin-p42219 |title=V√§rttin√§ |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which bear tinges of [[Popular music|contemporary]], [[pop music|Western]] influence‚Äîan increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music. World fusion / Worldbeat / Ethnic fusion / Global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of [[pop music|Western pop]]. Good examples are [[Paul Simon]]'s album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', on which South African [[Mbaqanga]] music is heard, [[Peter Gabriel]]'s work with Pakistani [[Sufi]] singer, [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], the [[Deep Forest]] project, in which vocal loops from [[West Africa]] are blended with Western, contemporary rhythmic textures and [[harmony|harmony structure]], and the work of [[Mango (singer)|Mango]], who combined pop and rock music with world elements.

More recent bands who exhibit experimentation with World music Hybrid Forms include [[Vampire Weekend]], [[The Very Best]], Island Cassettes &amp; [[Yeasayer]], many of which cite inspiration from the work of Paul Simon.

Depending on style and context, world music can sometimes share the [[new-age music]] genre, which is a category that often includes [[Ambient music]] and textural expressions from indigenous [[Folk music|roots]] sources. Good examples are [[Singing bowl|Tibetan bowls]], [[Tuvan throat singing]], [[Gregorian music|Gregorian chant]] or [[Native American flute]] music. World music blended with new-age music is a sound, loosely classified as the hybrid genre, ethnic fusion.  Examples of ethnic fusion are [[Nicholas Gunn]]'s &quot;Face-to-Face&quot; from ''Beyond Grand Canyon,'' featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers, and &quot;Four Worlds&quot; from ''The Music of the Grand Canyon'', featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Indian Nation]].

===World fusion===
The subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western [[jazz fusion]] elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix &quot;fusion&quot; in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed ''world fusion jazz'', ''[[Ethno-jazz|ethnic jazz]]'' or ''non-Western jazz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/world-fusion-d185 |title=World Fusion |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term ''[[worldbeat]]'', and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term, ''world music''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;/&gt; Throughout the 1970s and 80s, [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] in the [[jazz music]] genre implied a blending of jazz and [[rock music]], which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d299 |title=Fusion |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular non-Western genres==
Although it primarily describes traditional music, the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. [[South Africa]]n [[Township music|&quot;township&quot; music]]) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. [[Afro-Cuban music]]), although Western-style popular song sourced from non-English-speaking countries in [[Western Europe]] (e.g. [[French pop music]]) would not generally be considered world music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--By whom, and who says so?--&gt;

[[Paris]] is one of the great European capitals for world music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} For many years, the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]]. This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help promote the music.

[[Algeria]]n and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of [[Amazigh]] (Berber), [[ra√Ø]], and [[Gnawa music]]. Algerian ra√Ø also found a large French audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The West African community is also very large, integrated by people from [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Guinea]]. They have introduced [[Manding languages|manding]] [[Griot|jeli]] music, [[mbalax]] and other styles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== After 1987: WOMAD and beyond ==
One origin of the term was the initiation of [[F√™te de la Musique|World Music Day]] ([[F√™te de la Musique]]) in 1982 in France. World Music Day has been celebrated on 21 June every year since then. On 29 June 1987 a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre.  Arguably popular interest was sparked with the release in 1986 of [[Paul Simon]]'s ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' album.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Who so argues?--&gt; The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] and [[Savuka]]. This project and the work of [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Johnny Clegg (musician)|Johnny Clegg]] among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity. [[Zila Khan]] is one of today's leading singers in World Music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Before 1987, world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce. However, they were aware that the [[jazz]] and classical markets had developed a crossover audience. They decided the best way forward would be a collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

At around this time, [[Cultural Co-operation]] started the Music Village Festival. This regular series of free world music festivals continues to run. They also started a network of world music artists to help promote their work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1987 meeting===
At the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done:
{{quote|[He] felt that the main problem in selling our kind of material lay with the UK retail outlets and, specifically, the fact that they did not know how to rack it coherently. This discouraged [the retail stores] from stocking the material in any depth and made it more difficult for the record buyers to become acquainted with our catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.frootsmag.com/content/features/world_music_history/minutes/page03.html | title = Minutes of Meeting Between the Various 'World Music' Record Companies and Interested Parties, Monday 29 June 1987 | work = [[fRoots]] magazine | accessdate  = 2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under. Suggestions included &quot;world beat&quot; and prefixing words such as &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;tropical&quot; to existing genre titles. &quot;World music&quot; won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre‚Äîbut just something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. Afterward, they agreed that despite the publicity campaign, this wasn't an exclusive club‚Äîand that for the good of all, any label that sold this type of music could use the name.

Another issue was the distribution methods at the time. Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service. Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores.

==Marketing==
One of the marketing strategies used in the [[gramophone record|vinyl]] market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the &quot;world music&quot; campaign, it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included, presumably for shelf or rack edging.

In an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine ''[[NME]]''. The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.

By the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept‚Äînot just to national stations, but also regional [[DJ]]s keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make &quot;world music&quot; important to people outside London‚Äîmost regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.

The next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre‚Äîso new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the ''NME'' could again be involved in printing the chart and also ''[[Music Week]]'' and the London [[listings magazine]] ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]''. It was also suggested that [[Andy Kershaw]] might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.

== Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism ==
{{further|Music of Canadian cultures}}
In most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades. This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only has &quot;exotic&quot; imports, but also as local music played by fellow citizens. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]] or [[Chicano rock]] in the United States would be two obvious examples.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Who says so, and what condition prevents them from actually being so?--&gt;  But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms.  In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity, such as Haitian-American [[Wyclef Jean]], Somali-Canadian [[K'naan]], Tamil-Briton [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]], or Lebanese-Colombian [[Shakira]], often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop. Cuban-born singer-songwriter [[Addys Mercedes]] started of her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addysmercedes.com title=Addys Mercedes' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Once, an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two.  Now, new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers.  For example, the [[Punjabi music|Punjabi]]-[[Irish folk music|Irish]] fusion band [[Delhi 2 Dublin]] is from neither India nor Ireland, but [[Vancouver, Canada]].

In Vancouver,{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Vancouver, Washington, or Vancouver, BC?--&gt; musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments. The JUNO nominated [http://www.orchidensemble.com Orchid Ensemble] is a trio of two Chinese instruments and the marimba (plus other percussion instruments). It has been touring across North American since 1997. [http://www.vi-co.org The Vancouver Inter-Cultural Orchestra] stages musicians and instruments from China, Taiwan, India, Iran, Africa, Vietnam,.... with Canadian western orchestral players.

There is also Canada's most famous Traditional Indian Classical Musician, [[Cassius Khan]] who is an award winning internationally renowned as the world's only [[Ghazal]] singer who accompanies himself on the [[Tabla]] a two piece hand drum indigenous to India. Khan himself has not made his views unknown on his dislike to Robert E Brown's term &quot;World Music&quot; by publicly stating he found the term &quot;Colonial and Oppressing&quot; and he has been a hot issue in most underground meetings of the musical elites in Canada.{{or-inline|date=July 2014}}

==World Music Month==
The World Music Month was designated on October 1987.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} It is a music festival held at the Town &amp; Country Club in London, and it was the start of the winter season for both [[WOMAD]] and ''Arts Worldwide''. The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign.{{Vague|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--And these issues were what, exactly?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Since the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from 'outside' Western pop culture has been steadily mounting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} More and more international artists, many of whom are big stars in their own countries, are coming to England and North America on tour. They started off, like the [[Bhundu Boys]], playing small clubs and pubs, but now many acts are so popular that they are filling larger venues.

Examples of radio shows that feature world music include ''[[World of Music (radio show)|World of Music]]'' on [[Voice of America]], ''Transpacific Sound Paradise'' on [[WFMU]], ''The Planet'' on Australia's [[ABC Radio National]], DJ Edu presenting ''D.N.A: DestiNation Africa'' on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], [[Adil Ray]] on the [[BBC Asian Network]], [[Andy Kershaw]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 3]] and [[Charlie Gillett]]'s show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/wmusic.shtml |title=bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/wmusic |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[BBC World Service]].

==2010s radio programs==

World music radio programs today often play [[Music of Africa|African]] hip hop or [[reggae]] artists, [[crossover (music)|crossover]] [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] and [[Latin American]] jazz groups, etc.  Common media for world music include [[public radio]], [[webcasting]], the [[BBC]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and ABC ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]). The scope of what is considered world music has increased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  By default, non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music.

==Criticisms==
The generally accepted geographic standard for what designates world music is withstanding criticism for its universal asymmetry, where nearly every classifiable region under the term is defined, relative to [[Western culture|Western]] music culture; this is primarily due to the fact that dominant [[corporate structure]]s for music [[Record distribution|distribution]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] originate in {{nowrap| [[Western Europe]]}} and {{nowrap| [[North America]]}}, as do the forums for establishing industry genre categories.
Therefore, in market context, &quot;ethnic&quot; music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center.

Some musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term &quot;world music&quot;.
To these critics, &quot;world music&quot; is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres.
In {{nowrap| October 1999}}, {{nowrap| [[Luaka Bop]]}} label founder and ex-[[Talking Heads]] frontman [[David Byrne]] wrote an &quot;{{nowrap|I Hate World Music}}&quot; editorial in ''{{nowrap| [[The New York Times]]}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/I_hate_world_music_1999.php &quot;I Hate World Music&quot; editorial by David Byrne in ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; explaining his objections to the term.
Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as &quot;exotic&quot; serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers.

{{Main|Awards for world music}}

The BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008, sponsored by [[BBC Radio 3]]. The award was thought up by ''[[fRoots]]'' magazine's editor [[Ian A. Anderson|Ian Anderson]], inspired by the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]].  Award categories included:  Africa, Asia/Pacific, Americas, Europe, Mid East and North Africa, Newcomer, Culture Crossing, Club Global, Album of the Year, and Audience Award. Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts.  Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury, which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category.  These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/worldmusic/a4wm2008/faq.shtml |title=Radio 3‚ÄîAwards for World Music 2008 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual awards ceremony was held at the [[BBC Proms]] and winners were given an award called a &quot;Planet&quot;.  In March 2009, the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5940410.ece|title=Mystery of missing BBC music awards|last=Donovan|first=Paul|date=2009-03-22|accessdate=2009-03-21|publisher=The Sunday Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/20/bbc-radio-3-world-music-awards|title=BBC axes Radio 3 Awards for World Music|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-21|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the BBC's decision to end its awards program, the British world music magazine ''[[Songlines (magazine)|Songlines]]'' launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 &quot;to recognise outstanding talent in world music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songlines.co.uk/music-awards/winners.php Songlines Music Award winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[WOMEX Awards]] were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence, social importance, commercial success, political impact and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womex.com/realwomex/main.php?id_headings=131&amp;id_realwomex=13&amp;subheading=156#artist WOMEX Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;  Every October at the WOMEX event, the award figurine‚Äîan ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age‚Äîis presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community.

'''Absolute music''' (sometimes '''abstract music''') is music that is not explicitly &quot;about&quot; anything; in contrast to [[program music]], it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', ISBN 0-684-31377-4, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] but the term was not coined until 1846 where it was first used by [[Richard Wagner]] in a programme to [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music debate relate to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s aesthetic disinterestedness from his ''[[Critique of Aesthetic Judgment]]'', and has led to numerous arguments among musicians, composers, music historians and critics.

== The Spiritualist debate ==

A group of Romantics consisting of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Jean Paul Richter]] and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as &quot;spiritual absolutism&quot;. In this respect, instrumental music transcends other arts and languages to become the discourse of a ‚Äòhigher realm‚Äô ‚Äî rooted greatly in [http://academic.cengage.com/music/book_content/049557273X_wrightSimms_DEMO/assets/ITOW/7273X_INT_07_ITOW_Hoffmann.pdf Hoffmann‚Äôs famous review of Beethoven‚Äôs 5th Symphony], published in 1810. These protagonists believed that music could be more emotionally powerful and stimulating without words. According to Richter, music would eventually ‚Äòoutlast‚Äô the word.

==The Formalist debate==
‚ÄòFormalism‚Äô is the concept of ‚Äòmusic for music‚Äôs sake‚Äô and refers to instrumental music. In this respect, music has no meaning at all and is enjoyed by appreciation of its ‚Äòformal‚Äô structure and technical construction. The 19th century music critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence. In fact, these extra-musical ideas detracted from the beauty of the music. The 'Absolute', in this case, is the ‚Äòpurity‚Äô of the art.

:‚ÄúMusic has no subject beyond the combinations of notes we hear, for music speaks not only by means of sounds, it speaks nothing but sound.‚Äù ‚Äî Eduard Hanslick &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the [[liner notes]] to the [[Juilliard String Quartet]]'s ''Intimate Letters''. Sony Classical SK 66840.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism therefore rejected genres such as opera, song and tone poems as they conveyed explicit meanings or programmatic imagery. Symphonic forms were considered more aesthetically pure. (The choral finale of [[Beethoven]]‚Äôs Ninth Symphony, as well as the programmatic Sixth Symphony, became problematic to formalist critics who had championed the composer as a pioneer of the ‚ÄòAbsolute‚Äô, especially with the late quartets).

[[Carl Dahlhaus]] describes absolute music as music without a &quot;concept, object, and purpose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art and the Senses | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Bacci, Francesca  |author2=Melcher, David | year=2011 | pages=253 | isbn=9780199230600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition and objections to absolute music===

The majority of opposition to the idea of instrumental music being ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô came from [[Richard Wagner]]. It seemed ludicrous to him that art could exist without meaning, for him it had no right to exist.

[[Wagner]] considered the choral finale of [[Beethoven]]‚Äôs Ninth Symphony to be the proof that music works better with words, famously saying:

:‚ÄúWhere music can go no further, there comes the word‚Ä¶ the word stands higher than the tone.‚Äù ‚Äî Wagner{{Cite quote|date=February 2013}}

Wagner also called Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the death knell of the Symphony, for he was far more interested in combining all forms of art with his [[Gesamtkunstwerk]].

==Contemporary views==
Today, the debate continues over whether music has meaning or not.  However, most contemporary views, reflecting ideas emerging from views of subjectivity in [[linguistic meaning]] arising in [[Cognitive Linguistics]], as well as [[Kuhn]]'s{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2013}}{{failed verification|date=November 2013}} work on cultural biases in science and other ideas on meaning and [[aesthetics]] (e.g. [[Wittgenstein]] on cultural constructions in thought and language&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), appear to be moving 
towards a consensus that music provides at least some [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ification or meaning, in terms of which it is ''understood''.

The cultural bases of musical understanding have been highlighted in [[Philip Bohlman]]'s work, who considers music as a form of cultural communication:
:There are those who believe that music represents nothing other than itself. I argue that we are constantly giving it new and different abilities to represent who we are.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 | title =        The Meaning of Music
 | author =       Shula Neuman
 | journal =    The [[University of Chicago]] Chronicle

 | date =         April 2, 1998
 | pages =   Vol. 17, No. 13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bohlman has gone on to argue that the use of music, e.g. among the Jewish diaspora, was in fact a form of ''identity building''.

[[Susan McClary]] has critiqued the notion of ‚Äòabsolute music‚Äô, arguing that all music, whether explicitly programmatic or not, contains implicit programs that reflect the tastes, politics, aesthetic philosophies and social attitudes of the composer and their historical situation. Such scholars would argue that classical music is rarely about ‚Äònothing‚Äô, but reflects aesthetic tastes that are themselves influenced by culture, politics and philosophy. Composers are often bound up in a web of tradition and influence, in which they strive to consciously situate themselves in relation to other composers and styles. [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], on the other hand, believes music has no means to reserve a ‚Äúspecific layer or pocket for meaning. Once it has been brought into sustainable connection with a structure of prejudgment, music simply becomes meaningful.‚Äù

Music which appears to demand an interpretation, but is abstract enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. [[Tchaikovsky]]‚Äôs 6th Symphony), is what [[Lydia Goehr]] refers to as ‚Äòdouble-sided autonomy.‚Äô This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having ‚Äòno meaning to speak of‚Äô, music could be used to envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor (particularly common in [[Shostakovich]], most notably the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies).

===Linguistic meaning===
On the topic of musical meaning, 
[[Wittgenstein]], at several points in his late diary ''Culture and Value'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title = Culture and Value (''German: ''Vermischte Bemerkungen)
|author = [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] tr. Peter Winch 1984
|year = 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ascribes meaning to music, for instance, that in the finale, 
a conclusion is being ‚Äòdrawn‚Äô, e.g.:
: ‚Äú[one] can point to particular places in a tune by Schubert and say: look, that is the point of the tune, this is where the thought comes to a head.‚Äù (p.47)

Recently, [[Jerrold Levinson]] has drawn extensively on Wittgenstein to comment, in the Journal of Music and Meaning: 
:Intelligible music stands to literal thinking in precisely the same relation as does intelligible verbal discourse. If that relation be not exemplification but instead, say, expression, then music and language are, at any rate, in the same, and quite comfortable, boat.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Canto livre''' is a kind of music with roots in [[Alentejo]] music, predominantly inspired by political messages, in particular from left-wing thinkers. It was very common after the 1974 [[carnation revolution]] in Portugal, since the country had liberated from an almost 40 year right-wing dictatorship. Nowadays it is not heard much, although the term &quot;canto livre&quot; can also mean a gathering of singers which perform freely without charging for their show.

[[File:Fiddler in Wichita Riverfest.jpg|thumb|Fiddler in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] Riverfest]]
'''American fiddle'''-playing began with the early settlers who found that the small ''viol'' family instruments were portable and rugged. According to Ron Yule, &quot;John Utie, a 1620 immigrant, settled in the North and is credited as being the first known fiddler on American soil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;louisianafolklife1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/LFF_FiddlingInLouisiana.html |title=Living Traditions: Articles and Essays |publisher=Louisianafolklife.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early influences were Irish fiddle styles as well as Scottish and the more refined traditions of classical violin playing. Popular tunes included &quot;[[Soldier's Joy (fiddle tune)|Soldier's Joy]]&quot;, for which [[Robert Burns]] had written lyrics, and other such tunes as &quot;Flowers of Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;[[Tamlin]],&quot; which were claimed by both Scottish and Irish lineages.

Soon these tunes were Americanized; local variations developed in the Northern and Southern colonies. In contemporary American fiddle styles, the [[New England]] states are heavily influenced by all Celtic styles, including [[Cape Breton]] fiddle-playing; whereas Southern or &quot;Dixie&quot; fiddle styles have tended to develop their own traditions, which emphasize [[double stop]]s and in some instances the incorporation of dance calls or simple lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rye Whiskey, fiddle tune&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary fusionist trends==

In a radical departure from tradition, groups such as Trio Chipontepec are cropping up at American fiddle festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html |title=Early Look at 2011 Festival of American Fiddle Tunes Faculty - Fiddle Tunes at Centrum |publisher=Centrum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110705062212/http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html| archivedate= 5 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock is fusing with country, jazz with rock, and classical violinists are retooling in an era characterized by home recording studios and the easy availability of [[new media]] such as MP3 downloads.

==Fiddle playing distinguished from violin playing==

Some folk fiddlers distinguish &quot;fiddle&quot; from &quot;violin&quot;, though this is far from universal - many classical violinists refer to their &quot;fiddle&quot;. Nevertheless a few common differences may be observed;

===Instrument===
Generally, the setup of the instruments is different:

* Fiddle bridge is flatter
* Strings may be lower at the nut
* Strings heavier and more often steel rather than synthetic or gut
* Instruments may be hand made by amateur [[luthier]]s
* Fiddle more commonly set up with pickup
* Fiddle more commonly set up with individual string tuners; violinists who use tuners more likely to use tailpiece tuners

===Playing technique===

Fiddle playing generally avoids vibrato except for occasional slow tempo pieces and even then uses less [[vibrato]]. Shorter bowstrokes are also consistent with the fiddle players' tendency to use less [[legato]] and more [[detache]] bow strokes. Some, but not all, styles use double stops and open tunings. [[Trick fiddling]] is employed, often built upon [[cross bowing]] technique such as used in [[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]] or [[Beaumont Rag]].
Bowing by fiddle players is quite different in that they may intentionally grip the frog in a crude manner and typically choke up on the bow. See for instance Rhiannon Giddens of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNaK_nBp2Yc&amp;NR=1 Massachusetts performance] of ''Genuine Negro Jig'' in May 2010.

===Fiddle repertoire distinguished===

Fiddle players tend to play fiddle &quot;tunes&quot; rather than sonatas and other classical types of compositions. There are exceptions. For instance, [[partita]]s have been popular with fiddle players, particularly since publication of the Open House CD by [[Kevin Burke (musician)|Kevin Burke]], an Irish style player based in Portland, Oregon. Fiddles are typically associated with country and other genres of popular music while violins are usually associated with classical and other genres of art music.

==Types of tunes==
[[File:HillbillyFamilyBandDLange.jpg|thumb|Woman playing fiddle (right) with her family in a California migrant camp, 1939]]
* [[Reel (dance)|Reels]]
* [[Hornpipe]]s
* [[Polka]]s
* [[Jig]]s
** Slip Jigs
** Double Jigs
* [[Waltz]]es
* Songs with lyrics

=== Canonical Tunes ===

==== Orange Blossom Special ====
{{Main|Orange Blossom Special (song)}}
Also known as &quot;OBS&quot;, Orange Blossom Special exploits the capacity of fiddle or violin to imitate various mechanical tones. Authorship is controversial.

==== The Devil Went Down to Georgia ====
The canonical American fiddle tune, &quot;[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]&quot; was written by [[Charlie Daniels]] as an interpretation the &quot;Lonesome Fiddle Blues&quot; by Vassar Clements and has been covered innumerable times. Although classified as [[country rock]], the tune uses licks based on old-time fiddle playing and rock guitar riffs. Unlike most old-time playing, the instrument ranges high up the neck, exploiting both the legendary association of the fiddle as &quot;the devil's instrument&quot; and the intensity of rapid sixteenth or thirty-second notes. These effects are achieved through rapid detache bowing bordering on outright [[tremolo]]. The motif of a [[deal with the Devil]] may have been influenced by [[Cross Road Blues]], by Delta blues singer Robert Johnson.

==Blues fiddle==

According to London-based music writer Chris Haigh, fiddle  &quot; was among the primary instruments used by the rural blacks...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;name=Haigh http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/blues/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that by  1930 over 50 different black blues fiddle players had recordings. Many musicians who were guitar stars also played fiddle including:

* [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]]
* [[Big Bill Broonzy]]
* [[Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown]]

[[Blues]] fiddle uses the pentatonic blues scale to create riffs for breaks and over guitar chords typically in the standard [[blues progression]]. Vibrato is not often used, although may occasionally be used in an exaggerated manner for special effect.

==Old time fiddle==
{{Main|Old time fiddle}}
Old time fiddle uses a profusion of double stops and authentic players typically tune their instruments in &quot;open tunings&quot; or [[Scordatura|cross tunings]]. The set ups often include flattened bridges and in some cases no chin rest. The most popular tuning ia AEAE for the key of A, but the instrument can be down tuned to GDGD, which may put less tension on the neck when playing solo. ADAE is also popular for the key of D, and standard (GDAE) is often used for G. Some of the earliest popular repertoire includes &quot;Turkey in the Straw,&quot; &quot;Arkansas Traveler,&quot; &quot;Billy in the Lowground.&quot; Accompanying instruments include washboard, jug bass, banjo, dulcimer, guitar, and occasionally kazoo.

According to some sources, old time music is actually the &quot;early recorded country music of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly of the southeastern states&quot; thus narrowing the definition considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmet Baycu |url=http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm |title=Roots of American Fiddle Music |publisher=1001tunes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110707054457/http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a broader definition usually prevails which incorporates unrecorded music with roots long before radio transmission and sound recording were invented. Within old time music there are regional subgenres, such as the Deep South and Appalachia, where fiddle music is often intertwined with cultural phenomena such as [[Appalachian music#Coal mining and protest music|coal mining]].

A comprehensive review of old time fiddle styles was written by David Reiner and Peter Anick and published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Oldtime Fiddling Across America, by David Reiner and Peter Anick (1989), Mel Bay Publications. ISBN 0-87166-766-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bluegrass fiddle==

[[Bluegrass music]] originated in the person of Bill Monroe. According to Haigh, &quot;Monroe always considered the fiddle to be the key instrument of bluegrass&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiddlingaround1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/bluegrass/index.html |title=Bluegrass Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chubby Wise]] Played with Monroe. Also a Texas Swing player &lt;ref name=&quot;fiddlingaround1&quot;/&gt;
* [[Byron Berline]] a bluegrass player, has appeared with the Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers
* [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] Played with Monroe. Classical training, old time. Band: Seatrain. tric violin. COMPOSITION: &quot;What if Mozart had played with Bill Monroe; a concerto for violin and orchestra&quot;

==Cajun fiddle==
According to Ron Yule, &quot;Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 15th century in Scotland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;louisianafolklife1&quot;/&gt; The most widely known Cajun fiddler is [[Doug Kershaw]].

[[Zydeco]] music is closely related.

==Rock fiddle==
{{Main|Rock violin}}
Rock fiddle, like rock music in general, owes much to American blues. Incorporation of fiddle or violin into rock, as with jazz, has been a slow process, resisted by some critics as an&quot;unlikeliest and perverse misuse of an instrument&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/rock%20violin/index.html |title=Rock Violin |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has roots in [[folk music]] particularly the [[American folk revival]] of the 1960s, and thus as a matter of usage some writers refer to &quot;rock fiddle&quot; when discussing playing by classically trained musicians who join rock bands and thus import classical style rather than fiddle style into their playing.

* [[Papa John Creach]] ([[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Hot Tuna]]) played in a style more closely approaching true fiddle as opposed to violinistic style.
*[[Sugar Cane Harris]] (violin,technically), played with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Little Richard]] and  [[Johnny Otis]].
* [[Jerry Goodman]] (violin, technically), with [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]'s album ''[[Birds of Fire]]''.
* [[Scarlet Rivera]] (violin, technically), played with [[Bob Dylan]] on &quot;[[Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)|Hurricane]]&quot;.

Rock violinists often use solid body [[electric violin]]s to reduce feedback. Rock is an international phenomenon, and rock violin is consequently influenced by cross fertilizations from rock players such as Ashley MacIsaac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brad Wheeler |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/why-ashley-macisaac-decided-to-rock-his-fiddle/article2065835/ |title=Why Ashley MacIsaac decided to rock his fiddle |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless American rockers continue to experiment. For instance, eclectic rocker Natalie Stovall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nataliestovall.com/2011/01/29/amarillo-article-about-todays-show/ |title=News ‚Äì Amarillo Globe-News Article ¬´ Natalie Stovall |publisher=Nataliestovall.com |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of Berkelee Conservatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm |title=Natalie Stovall - Indie Artist Spotlight on |publisher=Countrystarsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110704090815/http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm| archivedate= 4 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers [[Led Zeppelin]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[The White Stripes]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], all the while alternating between standard rock vocals and fiddle/violin riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnRjMq_kDVU |title=Natalie Stovall - Crazy Rock/Fiddle Medley - Chicago |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock fiddle or violin players include

* [[Byron Berline]] a bluegrass player, has appeared with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Gram Parsons]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]
* [[Rufus Thibodeaux]] ([[Neil Young]])
* [[John Cale]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] notable tracks include &quot;Heroin&quot;

==American jazz fiddle==
{{see also|Stuff Smith|Joe Venuti|Noel Pointer|Western swing fiddle}}
Jazz playing on the fiddle is often called jazz violin but there are some instances in which &quot;jazz fiddle&quot; is discussed. For instance Mel Bay contributor Martin Norgard presents jazz fiddle in numerous media (book, website).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm |title=A Practical Guide To Jazz Improvising For Strings |publisher=Jazz Fiddle Wizard |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110719024330/http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, instructional jazz playing was preceded by  the highly influential 1992 Oak Publications volume Jazz Violin&quot; by Matt Glaser and [[Stephane Grapelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jazz Violin| Grappelli and Glaser| Publisher: Music Sales America |(January 1, 1992)|ISBN 0-8256-0194-0|ISBN 978-0-8256-0194-1&lt;/ref&gt; The topic is indeed covered on the Wikipedia online encyclopedia at the article page entitled [[Jazz violin]]. Australian jazz player [[Ian Cooper (violinist)|Ian Cooper]] is presented as a violinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iancooper.com/ian_cooper_biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Ian Cooper |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch eclectic player Tim Kliphuis presents his jazz instructional material as &quot;Jazz Swing Violin Fiddle&quot; but his website quotes the Glasgow Herald review which denominates hims as a &quot;splendid young...violinist&quot;.

== Texas swing ==
{{see also|Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys|Chris Daring|Buddy Spicher|Benny Thomasson}}
This music, usually considered to be synonymous with [[Western swing]], is ''bona fide'' fiddle music and is deeply intertwined with country and folk music as played by Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Dale Watson, the Wheel's Jason Roberts, Jesse Dayton, and Garrison Keillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnygimble.com/ |title=Welcome to Johnny Gimble's world of Texas Swing! |publisher=Johnnygimble.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110724102847/http://www.johnnygimble.com/| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known example of this music is &quot;[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]&quot;, which despite some controversy is generally attributed to Bob Wills.:&lt;ref&gt;^ Wolff, Country Music, p. 112: &quot;It ['Faded Love'] originated with western swing pioneer Bob Wills, who grew up in the 1910s and '20s fiddling in rural Texas with his father, John Wills. They wrote the melody together when Bob was very young; it wasn't until 1950 that the song gained lyrics, courtesy of Bob's younger brother, Billy Jack.&lt;/ref&gt;*[[Mark O'Connor]] is a legendary performer who also plays bluegrass and jazz but got started as a youth contender in fiddle contests.

== New England, &quot;Down East,&quot; Yankee, or Boston fiddle ==

New England fiddle playing is exemplified by [[Rounder Records]] artist Frank Ferrel.&lt;ref&gt;Notable as heard on ''A Prairie Home Companion.'' In the Boston Globe he was referred to  as &quot;one of the finest living masters,&quot; of that genre.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the style as &quot;Down East&quot; in his volume ''Boston Fiddle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankferrel.com/ |title=Official Website |publisher=Frank Ferrel |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other fiddle traditions, piano accompaniment is common, and, he notes occasionally saxophone or clarinet would join in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/frank-ferrel/album/boston-fiddle-the-dudley-street-tradition&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature is frequent use of minor keys particularly G minor and also the &quot;flat keys&quot; of F Major and B flat Major, which are not typically used in Old Time and other indigenous music traditions.  Ferrell traces his roots into the 1800s Boston Scottish and Irish cultures as typified in musicians such as William Bradbury Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan's Mammoth Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Like all Celtic American fiddle traditions, his is influenced by the publication of Chief O'Neil's massive directory of fiddle tunes in 1903 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/ireland/index.html |title=Irish Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ferrel and others in the North East tradition use the full panoply of Irish fiddle ornamentation.

* Bowed Triple
*The Cut
* The Double Cut
* The Long Roll
* The Short Roll
* The Slide
Other influences include [[Scottish fiddling]] and Cape Breton style, which has its own blend of Celtic traditions which include also Normandy styles.

==Canadian and other international influence==

'''Jaiva''' or Township Jive (&quot;TJ&quot;) is a [[Music genre|subgenre]] of South African township music and [[African dance]] form&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Y58CjwsXs |title=Jaiva |publisher=YouTube |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xykC1IP6odU|Tina and Mvuyisi jiving at the Ikamva Lethu centre in Kayamandi South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; which has influenced Western break dance&lt;ref&gt;band=Wozani |title= Township Jive |http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-pdj9oC_5s&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged from the [[shebeen]] culture of the apartheid era [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].

==Influences and particularity==

While closely associated with [[mbaqanga]], Township Jive more broadly incorporates some influences from mariba and kwaito&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghananaija.com/movies/index.php?option=com_hwdvideoshare&amp;task=viewvideo&amp;Itemid=53&amp;video_id=3823 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than mbaqanga, neither of which is it synonymous. To the extent mariba influences TJ, it may be somewhat sanitised as TJ broke into the international commercial arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland Encyclopedia of Music&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Ruth|title=Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Garland Pub.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in world music circles==

Also featured on the Graceland album were [[The Boyoyo Boys]], who received additional press coverage when [[Malcolm McLaren]] allegedly plagiarised their song &quot;Puleng&quot; and released it as the hit &quot;[[Double Dutch (song)|Double Dutch]]&quot;, capitalising on the emergence of [[breakdance]] and [[hip-hop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com&quot;&gt;Ambrose Ehirim|Sunday, 9 December 2007|The Boyoyo Boys and Township Jive Today |http://magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com/ambrose-ehirim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional momentum for [[world beat]] attention to South African music developed as a result of international attention to the demise of [[apartheid]] and Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert in Wembley Stadium, London in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==History==

According to Ambrose Ehirim, a US-based Nigeria specialist,&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com&quot;/&gt; township music traces to the 1950s when it was proscribed by South African police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehirim |first=Ambrose |url=http://samakamusic.blogspot.com/2007/12/boyoyo-boys-and-township-jive-today.html |title=Amazano Music: The Boyoyo Boys and Township Jive Today |publisher=Samakamusic.blogspot.com |date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contradicted by the assertion of anti-apartheid activist/musician [[Johnny Clegg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Johnny+Clegg |title=Johnny Clegg |publisher=Everything2.com |date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;by the 1960s, the development of umbaqanga hadn't even really started&quot;. Mbaqanga or Umbaquanga has been characterised as urban pop music &quot;with high-pitched, choppy guitar and a powerful bass line&quot; influenced by &quot;funk, reggae, American R&amp;B, soul and drawing on South African Marabi, gospel music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com |title=Everything2 |publisher=Everything2 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws on both kweli and maribi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/user/StrawberryFrog/writeups/mbaqanga |title=mbaqanga (thing) by StrawberryFrog |publisher=Everything2.com |date=9 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Township Jive is closely associated with the development of baquanga, umbaquanga or mbaqanga but is distinguished in that it is more closely associated with emergent international trends and not as insular and rooted in tradition as mbaqanga.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Meintjes (1996). Review of Christopher Ballantine 'Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville', ''Popular Music'', 15, pp 245‚Äì247 {{doi|10.1017/S0261143000008187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Ballantine traces the &quot;shift from imitating American jazz to localizing the sound with African features. This he connects to the emergence of the ideology of New Africanism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ballantine|Christopher Ballantine 'Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville|xxxx|xxxx&lt;/ref&gt; While the international market was absorbing Township Jive under the swirl of commercial activity culminating in the McLaren copyright infringement lawsuit and the subsequent release of triumphant BBoy's new album was preferred amongst a more elite listening audience closely associated with the black diasphora consciousness movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Louise Meintjesa1 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2646784&amp;fulltextType=BR&amp;fileId=S0261143000008187 |title=Cambridge Journals Online ‚Äì Popular Music ‚Äì Abstract ‚Äì Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville. By Christopher Ballantine. Johannesburg: Raven Press, 1993. xii + 116 pp., taped examples |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually Township Jive and Mbaqanga are inter-changeable and this article is taking you all down the wrong path.  It arose from the penny-whistle music called kwela which became hugely popular in the 1950s, particularly in the shape of [[Spokes Mashiyane]] or &quot;King Kwela&quot;.   When Spokes recorded a song on the saxophone rather than the penny whistle in 1958 called Big Joe Special (Quality, TJ 500) it had an immediate impact and kwela music faded as the new Sax Jive took over into the 1960s and dominated the South African music scene for the next 20 years, also knocking Marabi (S. African big band Jazz) off its perch of popularity.  The resulting music was coined mbaqanga (cornbread) by trumpeter Michael Xaba, either as a way of downgrading it, or perhaps acknowledging that musicians need to eat. Mbaqanga IS Township Jive. &lt;ref&gt; http://electricjive.blogspot.com/search?q=mbaqanga+coined+cornbread&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
The homogenisation of Township Jive with US and UK culture, due to [[globalisation]], is viewed by African artists as a threat to the preservation of their local tradition and credibility. Thus, artists focus on maintaining an emotional link between customer and brand. This explains why transnational corporations are much less interested in homogenising or Americanizing kwaito music because true kwaito represents and dictates South African experience.&lt;ref&gt;Magubane, Zine. The Vinyl Aint Final &quot;Globalization and Gangster Rap: Hip Hop in the post-Apartheid City&quot;. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Americanizing kwaito, as is many artists' opinion, can potentially dilute the substance kwaito was originally based on.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Sharlene. &quot;Is Kwaito South African Hip Hop? Why the answer matters and who it matters to&quot;. May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On the upside, critical awareness of TJ has enhanced appreciation of fusion artists and others influenced by its style. For instance, Vibration Bookings bills its artist Nomfusi as a proponent of &quot;a new style where South African Township Jive (&quot;Jaiva&quot;) meets Motown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vibrationbooking.com/nomfusi.html |title=Nomfusi, Manou Gallo, Ernestine Deane, Layori, Batucada Sound Machine ‚Äì Delicioustunes booking- concerts- management |publisher=Vibrationbooking.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Boyoyo Boys have, subsequent to the copyright scandal, signed by [[Rounder Records]] which released ''TJ Today'' in 1998.

'''Filk music''' is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction/fantasy fandom]] and a type of [[fan labor]]. The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s. The term (originally a [[typographical error]]) predates 1955.&lt;ref name = &quot;Coppa in Hellekson and Busse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

==Etymology and definitions==
As Interfilk's ''What it is?'' page demonstrates, there is no consensus on the definition of filk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm Filk Music: What is it?]. Last revised: September 23, 2013. Accessed Nov. 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.

===Style and content===
Filk has been defined as [[folk music]], usually with a science fiction or [[fantasy]] theme, but this definition is not exact. '''Filkers''' have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats.  In addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as [[blues]], [[calypso music|calypso]], and even [[rock music|rock]] appear from time to time.

===Performer===
Filk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at [[science fiction conventions|science fiction/fantasy conventions]].  This definition might be summarized as, &lt;!-- '&quot;I can't define it, but I can point at it.&quot;'--&gt; &quot;We can argue what it is until we're red or green or blue, but when filkers get together it's the thing we do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Definition of Filk&quot;  [song title], Mark Mandel, ''ConSonance 2003 Songbook'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
Yet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. As described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking.  The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the &quot;performer vs. audience&quot; dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Barry and Sally Childs-Helton|Dr. Sally Childs-Helton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html Filkontario.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

By any of these definitions, filk is a form of music created from within [[science fiction fandom|science fiction and fantasy fandom]], often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in Canada, England, Germany, and the USA.  The boundaries of filking are vague. For example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] or at [[LARP]]s.

===Verb===
The word &quot;filk&quot; has also evolved as a verb, with two common meanings:
# To participate in a filk song [[Filk music#Filk Circle|circle]], as in, &quot;We were filking last night until three in the morning.&quot;
# To write a filk music [[Parody music|parody]] of an existing song, as in, &quot;I filked 'Hope Eyrie'.&quot; When used in this way, &quot;filk&quot; does not imply that all song parodies are considered filk music, nor does it imply that all filk songs are parodies.  Setting satirical or parody lyrics to established tunes is not exclusively the province of science fiction fandom. Works of [[parody music]] such as those found in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' or performed by [[Weird Al Yankovic]] have their own long-established traditions and history.

==Styles and subjects==
In keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. While a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from [[Rock music|rock]], [[a cappella]] vocal groups, or other styles. The hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. One of the few rock-style groups in filk has been [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]], whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock.  Some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it into electronica and hip-hop music such as 76's ''Objects in Space'' (an homage to the popular TV show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', which itself featured several filk songs) and [[DJ Qbert|DJ Qbert's]] ''[[Wave Twisters]].''

The range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. Many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. Other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/09/68697 |first= Xeni |last= Jardin |title= Filk Music for Nerd People| work= Wired |date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). Many filk songs (such as [[Leslie Fish|Leslie Fish's]] &quot;[[Carmen Miranda|Carmen Miranda's]] Ghost Is Haunting Space Station 3&quot;) are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like [[Steve Macdonald (filk musician)|Steve Macdonald's]] &quot;Journey's Done&quot;).

However, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. Such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. These are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.

A significant number of filk songs are [[Parody music|parodies]], whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Bragg |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |title=Filk: Sci-fi meets folk music |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Filk_Sci-fi_meets_folk_music_98699099.html?showFullArticle=y |date=18 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. Although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the proportion of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.

One subtype of filk songs is the &quot;ose&quot; song, one on themes of death and gloom.  The term derives from the word &quot;morose&quot;, as in &quot;ose, morose, even-more-ose&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rogow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogow|first1=Roberta|title=Futurespeak: A Fan's Guide to the Language of Science Fiction|date=1991|publisher=Paragon House|page=238|location=New York|isbn=978-1557783479|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further variant is &quot;cheeri-ose&quot;: ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating such a subject lightheartedly (cf. [[Tom Lehrer|Tom Lehrer's]] &quot;Irish Ballad&quot;).

==History==
For the first few decades of the occasional [[science fiction convention]], there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. Part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. Some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of New York fans called [[Futurians|The Futurians]], and were written by [[Fred Pohl]] and [[Cyril Kornbluth]] (see [[Damon Knight|Damon Knight's]] book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). With the break up of the city clubs common during the [[Great Depression]], filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.

In the early 1950s, the term ''filk music'' started as a misspelling of ''folk music'' in an essay by Lee Jacobs, &quot;The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music&quot;. Wrai Ballard, then editor of the Spectator [[amateur press association|Amateur Press Society]] refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Post Office]] under the [[Comstock Laws]], but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly;&lt;ref name=Gold97&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Lee|authorlink1=Lee Gold|title=An Egocentric and Convoluted History of Early Filk and Filking|url=http://www.fanac.org/Fan_Histories/filkhist.html|website=The Fanac Fan History Project|accessdate=20 November 2014|quote=Lee Jacobs, a LArea fan who [...] in the 50s, [had] submitted an essay to SAPS (Spectator Amateur Press Society) entitled ‚ÄúThe Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music‚Äù about supposed science fiction incidents in folk song, which was a straight-faced analysis of a number of thoroughly filthy ‚Äúdirty songs,‚Äù taking various metaphors in them as if they were meant literally.}} Originally published in the ''[[ConChord]] 12 Songbook'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; thus,  Jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions.  Its first documented deliberate use was by [[Karen Anderson (writer)|Karen Anderson]] in ''Die Zeitschrift f√ºr vollst√§ndigen Unsinn'' (''The Journal for Utter Nonsense'') #774 (June 1953), for a song written by her husband [[Poul Anderson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;firstUse&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |title=Tracking Down The First Deliberate Use Of &quot;Filk Song&quot; |accessdate=2006-11-25 |first= Lee |last=Gold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music.  While many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some remained popular for decades.  By the late 1970s, periodicals such as ''Kantele'' and ''Philk Fee-Nom-Ee-Non'' offered a ready outlet for filk writers.

At the 1974 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] author [[Robert Asprin|Bob Asprin]] announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night.&lt;ref name=&quot;dorsaiHistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.di.org/di_f_his.htm |title=Filk Music and the Dorsai Irregulars |accessdate=2006-11-25 |author=John Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. Some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with FilkCon in Chicago in 1979, organized by Margaret Middleton and Curt Clemmer, later joined by BayFilk in Northern California; the [[Ohio Valley Filk Fest]] (OVFF) in Columbus, Ohio; ConChord in Los Angeles, California; Musicon in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[FilKONtario]] near [[Toronto]], Ontario; a rotating British filkcon, and one (NEFilk) in the northeastern US;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nefilk.us/ NEFilk]&lt;/ref&gt; the German FilkCONtinental;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filkcontinental.de/fc/home/index.php FilkCONtinental] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

These efforts grew to include raising funds for traveling filkers. The first was a British Filk Fund. then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in North America created Interfilk, which is now the most active traveling filker fund. Beginning with British filker Mike Whitaker in 1992, 40 filkers were the beneficiaries of Interfilk subsidies in its first decade. OVFF began presenting the [[Pegasus Award]] annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and FilkOntario started the Filk Hall of Fame in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.

After years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s.  These included ''Folk Songs for Folk Who Ain't Been Yet'', featuring Leslie Fish and friends, and ''Children of the Future'' by Karen Willson.

[[Off Centaur Publications]] was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. As the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.

E-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. In the late 1980s, California filker Kay Shapero created the filk group on the [[Fidonet]] hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. The later creation of other electronic forums ‚Äî the Usenet group, a United Kingdom e-mail list FILK_UK and the German language list, an IRC channel devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on [[LiveJournal]] (including a LiveJournal community&lt;ref&gt;http://filk.livejournal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;), to pick a few examples ‚Äî have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). The availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. A few years into the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.

On the album ''Precious Friend'', [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] perform &quot;Old Time Religion&quot;, in a filk version.  Most of the verses of this version were by [[Gordon R. Dickson|Gordon Dickson]]; when Seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to Dickson.

==Filk Circle==
Filk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a ''Filk Circle''. Similar to the [[drum circle|Drum Circles]] and Bardic Circles found at [[society for creative anachronism|SCA]] events and other [[science fiction fandom|fannish]] events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.

Filk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. Although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. The purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. In a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. Those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both. Performers may know only one song, or may know an extensive library of songs. Participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.

Filk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. Filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. Local parties called ''housefilks'' are day-long events organized around a single filk circle held in the host's home.

===Physical layout===
[[File:2006-05-27 Baycon 2006 Saturday Night Open Filk Circle- Photo by Tony Fabris.jpg|thumb|right|A Filk circle at a science fiction convention.]]
As the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  The details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. The purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: By having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.{{Cn|reason=isn't this just - well the obvious way to do it?|date=November 2015}}

A formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. A circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small must enlarge as the number of participants grows. The disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle (space permitting).

===Time of day===
Traditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  Of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. Filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. Those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel to have space available for the entire night. There are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example, to allow participants to get home to sleep.

===Musical instruments===
At most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. Most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.

A wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the [[acoustic guitar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable [[electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and even [[theremin]]s are not unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Brenda|title=Guest of Honor : Dr. Mary Crowell|url=http://conflikt.org/guestbio.php?name=Dr.+Mary+Crowell&amp;title=Guest+of+Honor&amp;year=2011|website=Conflikt: A Pacific NorthWest Filk Convention|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2011|quote=We watched this beautiful young woman lug her keyboard (not the most portable of filk instruments, mind you) into the filk room with a slight amount of dread and a large measure of anticipation. And then she played her opening measures -- all Gershwiny, bluesy, and fine -- we all relaxed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small drum kits and [[double bass|upright basses]] can be found at some filk circles. A large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and Celtic instruments such as [[fiddle]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[banjo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], [[bodhran|bodhr√°ns]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and [[goblet drum|darbukas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Weird Sisters (band)]]. &quot;The group performs filk music (science fiction/fantasy folk music) with harp, double bass, guitar, and bodhran accompaniment.&quot; Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song presentation===
Songs are presented very informally. They can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. Songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. Songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. Songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed [[a cappella]]. Songs can be original songs, [[cover version|covers]], [[parody music|parodies]], [[instrumental]]s, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.

An active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. Filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Types===
[[File:Sfcon-music-session-ddb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Filk circle]]
Filk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.&lt;ref name=Gold:Welcome&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Lee|authorlink1=Lee Gold|title=Welcome to the Filk Circle|url=http://www.massfilc.org/FilkCircle.pdf|website=MASSFILC: The Filk Music Club of New England|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bardic====
In a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any), go in turns, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. Each participant is given the choice of ''pick, pass, or play''. &quot;Pick&quot; means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. &quot;Pass&quot; means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. &quot;Play&quot; means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.

The advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure, which enforces politeness. It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. There are disadvantages, however. A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. Such a circle was lamented in a filk by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]: &quot;I've been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Song at the Ready&quot; by Suzette Haden Elgin http://www.skeptictank.org/files/en003/filk-018.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good &quot;follower&quot; song is reduced.

====Chaos====
In a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. Frequently the word &quot;follower!&quot; is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;&gt;Gold, Lee; http://www.kayshapero.net/filkcirc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. &quot;Runs&quot; of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: It's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention.

====Token Bardic====
A token bardic circle, also known as a &quot;poker-chip&quot; bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see ''Bardic'', above). When all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;/&gt;

The advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. The disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.

There are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. A given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. It's common to see the participants of a bardic circle &quot;go chaos&quot; or vice versa, for example.

===Etiquette===
The etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. Everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.&lt;ref name=Gold:Welcome /&gt;

Although singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like [[jam session]]s. Jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. Singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. The exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.

Disruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. This includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. If between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout &quot;Filker up!&quot; as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.

==Cultural perspective==
There are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.

At a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist Sally Childs-Helton said, ''We have taken our right to be creative and to literally &quot;play&quot; in the best sense of that word.'' Filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand‚Äîa dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's [http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/hope-eyrie.html Hope Eyrie].) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs,&lt;ref name=Launius&gt;{{cite web|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|title=Got Filk? Lament For Apollo In Modern Science Fiction Folk Music|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.IAC-04-IAA.6.16.1.06|website=Aerospace Research Central|publisher=5th International Astronautical Congress 2004; Vancouver; Canada|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2004-10-05}} The exact date is taken from the [http://www.iaaweb.org/iaa/Publications/vancouver2004fp.pdf congress program], p.106.
Printed in ''[[Quest: The History of Spaceflight]]'', Bethesda, MD, USA: International Space Business Council, 12 (4) ([http://www.spacehistory101.com/product_p/v124.htm 2005]), Johnson, Stephen, ed. {{ISSN|1065-7738}}&lt;/ref&gt; pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996&lt;ref name=Nye /&gt;).

Within the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. Those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. The repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. Whether the occasion is a '''housefilk''' in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.

That openness to participation is a marked norm in filking,&lt;ref name=Jenkins92 /&gt; which makes it unusual in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts.  Mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.

Occasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. Newsgroup debates over such topics as [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.filk/browse_thread/thread/27e133d9408370ba/ca2d4f0a1b157027?lnk=st&amp;q=filk+'weird+al'&amp;rnum=3&amp;hl=en#ca2d4f0a1b157027 whether 'Weird Al' Yankovic is a filker] suggest the deep feelings involved. In practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered '''found filk'''.&lt;ref name=Launius /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nye&gt;{{cite book | last = Nye | first = David E. | authorlink = | title = American Technological Sublime | publisher = MIT Press | year = 1994 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-262-64034-1 | oclc = 36213568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins92&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Jenkins | title = Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = | chapter = 'Strangers No More We Sing': Filk Music, Folk Culture, and the Fan Community | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-415-90571-0 | oclc = 26055104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm |title=Acceptance Speeches of Barry &amp; Sally Childs-Helton |accessdate=2007-11-29 |last=Childs-Helton |first=Barry |author2=Sally Childs-Helton |date=2003-03-29 |work=Filk Hall of Fame |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023190656/http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon H.

==Pegasus Awards==
The [[Pegasus Award]]s were founded to recognize and honor excellence in filking. These awards are given annually at the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (or OVFF). Anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. It is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.

Currently awards are given in six categories: Best Song, Best Performer, Best Writer/Composer, Best Classic Song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. Some examples of past categories include: Best Love Song, Best Literature Song, Best Techie Song, Best Sing Along, etc.

The OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for Finalists for the Pegasus Awards (the Nominating Ballot) during the late spring and summer. There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the Nominating Ballot. The Finalist Ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF. Voting can be done online‚Äîeither to nominate Finalists, or to vote for the Finalists themselves. The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert. The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/index.html Pegasus Awards site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filk Hall of Fame==
The Filk Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofmain.html Filk Hall of Fame site]&lt;/ref&gt; was created by David Hayman in 1995 as a complement to the Pegasus Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Judith Hayman|author2=Dave Hayman|title=The Filk Hall of Fame: A Short History|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofhistory.html|website=Filk Hall of Fame|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Pegasus Awards acknowledge writing and performing, and therefore often reflect who or what is currently popular, the Hall of Fame was intentionally designed to acknowledge long-term or lasting contributions, including those largely behind the scenes.

Anyone may make a nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofnom.html Filk Hall of Fame nomination process]&lt;/ref&gt;  A nomination consists of a description of what the nominee has contributed to filk music and the filk community.  Nominations are reviewed annually by a jury consisting of the convention committee of [[FilKONtario]] (with the exception of David Hayman, who serves as administrator) and a representative from the committees of each of that year's other filk conventions.  The jury members vote independently by secret ballot, and thereby select that year's inductees.  Typically, three people are inducted each year, at the banquet at [[FilKONtario]].  A small editorial committee combines and edits the text of the nomination(s) to produce a citation, which is read aloud at the banquet presented to the inductee along with a plaque, and posted on the Hall of Fame web site.

'''Burban''' is a sub-culture (standing for &quot;Brown Urban&quot;) and an attempt to unify Urban musicians of Asian descent. The idea has caused a split amongst the bigger artists and critics due to the ambiguity of the term itself. The common misconception of Burban is that it is a musical genre of Asian origin, which is incorrect. Burban is a sub-culture of Hip Hop/R&amp;B music, focused on artists of Asian background. The reason behind this was to abolish the term Urban Desi, which commonly pigeon-holed 'Hip Hop' artists as 'Desi' artists.

==History==

===2000s: Urban Asian Origins===

After years of stigma being associated with the term 'Urban Desi' and the confusion of it supposedly being a genre - which was used by the majority of national media - a select few artists decided to destroy, recreate and bring in the new term for the sub-culture: Burban. However the 'B' stands for Brown and there was criticism that it might prejudice against the universality of music. Many Asian artists have refused to use the term (notably Sam Kay), but a growing number have decided to rebrand themselves by the word Burban. As the movement is in its infancy, there has been much confusion and deliberation of the semantics of Burban.

===2010s: The Birth of Burban===

The 2011 [[Brit Asia]] Awards ceremony was the birthplace, and official confirmation of the Burban movement. A performance by rapper [[Shizzio]] got the entire theatre talking after a showcase with fifteen artists. An all-star cast finished Shizzio's record Come Get Some, with Drilla Kid, Swami Baracus, [[Kazz Kumar]], Raxstar, Kee, Metz &amp; Trix, PSG, Jammer, Shabba D and Big Narstie performing, before a final bow with the entire crew on stage. The term Burban had been used before (for example, the original &quot;Burban Cypher&quot; was uploaded onto YouTube on 25 July 2011) but was given context on 1 October 2011 at the awards ceremony.

===Level of Support===

The level of support for &quot;Burban&quot; artists has traditionally been questionable, prompting the need for a rebranding. However, there have been notable champions: presenters from Buzz Asia including Doni Brasco and Amy K; Sumit of The Hip Hop Chronicle; DJ's such as Dreypa, Fricktion and Jesal; the BBC Asian Network's Bobby Friction, Nihal, DJ Kayper and Kan D Man. In 2011 (and continuing into 2012), there has been a wider circle of support growing. Journalists such as Asjad Nazir (of Eastern Eye) have been including features and interviews on artists from the scene; the website SuperCritic.tv (now taken over by Jesal) was the first website to critically assess the music (and score it), in the process giving birth to new sites such as The Brown Scene and Burban Blog; TV channels, such as Brit Asia, have playlisted various artists, and have given interview shows to musicians such as Shizzio, whilst Kiss TV has created a new Asian Beats Chart Show (with the help of PR gurus Terry Mardi and Pedro Carvalho). Whilst the impact on the charts has been negligible, there have been notable successes in newer forms of media - for example, Raxstar's video for &quot;Jaaneman&quot; gained over a million YouTube hits. There have, however, been voices of concern about the disambiguation with pre-existing or related forms of the word, although they appear to be dissipating as time progresses. However, the frequent criticism about the lack of a &quot;unifying sound&quot; remains.

'''''Logobi''''' (also written in [[French language|French]] as '''''Logobie''''') is an urban musical genre that accompanies certain dance moves. It first appeared in [[C√¥te d'Ivoire]] in 1986 and was popularized initially in university campuses in Abidjan. It became an international dance trend that moved to other African countries and eventually continental [[Europe]]. The dance is based on C√¥te d'Ivoire's traditional [[Zouglou]] dance with new elements added. &quot;''Zouglou''&quot; and &quot;''logobi''&quot; are used interchangeably, although &quot;''zouglou''&quot; is more ancient and &quot;''logobi''&quot; is a more modern development.

==Etymology==
The literal meaning of &quot;''logobi''&quot; in [[Nouchi]] (an Ivorian slang) is to earn money through cunning, crafty and often trickery means to earn a fortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;afropop&quot;&gt;According to Siddhartha Mitter, ''The Hip Hop Generation: Ghana's Hip Life and Ivory Coast's Zouglou''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the dance moves accompanying the music are depictions of bandits, hooligans and street gangs, including fight moves, use of weapons, secret gang signals and sexual overtures. The music and dance try to convey the social realities of poverty and misery aspiring at the same time to a happier, more positive future and longing for prosperity, justice and peace. It has also been dubbed &quot;la danse des gros bras&quot; (literally, the dance of big arms). The European, particularly French, development of &quot;''logobi''&quot; has also included electric and tecktonic elements to the music, diluting the gang aspects of the original dance by gearing it towards children and young adults.

==Artists==
Since its inception, the number of artists in the genre has proliferated not only in C√¥te d'Ivoire and neighboring African countries but in Europe, and partricularly France, most notably within the African immigrant communities. Well-known artists playing &quot;''logobi''&quot; music include Les Garagistes, Espoir 2000, [[Magic System]], Petit Yod√© and l'Enfant Siro, [[Soum Bill]], Didier Bil√©, Vieux Gazeur, Petit Denis, Fitini, Lato Crespino, Moli√®re, Les Pivoines, Les Patrons, Les Mercenaires, Anti Palu, Sur-choc, Khunta and Sixko, Bayon, Malmo, Les Salopard, Dezy Champillon, Major and Zabson, Oxig√®ne, C ki'sa, [[LogobiGT]], Les Mantanien and Yang Systeme.

Successful singles and music videos include the hits &quot;Djolo National&quot; by Yang Systeme, &quot;Logobi&quot; by Les Mantanien, &quot;Logobi&quot; by Les Youl√©s, &quot;Sucr√© Sal√©&quot; by Logobi Gt and &quot;[[Logobitombo (Corde √† sauter)|Logobitombo]]&quot; by [[Moussier Tombola]].

'''Nitzhonot''' (Hebrew: ◊†◊¶◊ó◊ï◊†◊ï◊™, &quot;victories&quot;) is a crossover between [[Goa trance]] and [[uplifting trance]], emerged during the mid-late 1990s in [[Israel]].

==Genre==
Nitzhonot seems to blend hard pulsating basses, sometimes referred to as &quot;laserkicks&quot;, with the Eastern melodies typical for [[India]]n Goa Trance from 1996 and 1997. The tracks are usually in a range of 145-155 BPM.

At the height of its popularity,  Nitzhonot reached mainstream success in Israel. The most notable artist from this genre is [[Eyal Barkan]]&amp;Holymen, who released his album 'Good Morning Israel' in 1998. It became the first trance record that achieved gold status in its home country, selling more than 20,000 copies (bootleg versions accounted for 80,000). Other artists from Greece and Israel would also gain popularity that year.

Before most artists in Israel changed their direction to [[Psychedelic trance|Full On]], artists in [[Greece]] captured the flow of this music. At the beginning of a new millennium Nitzhonot, now renamed as Uplifting, would stand up again, raising in popularity. Some of the most famous Greek acts were [[Cyan]], Darma, Cherouvim, Star Children, Space Odyssey, Dementia and many others, some of which are still producing uplifting trance and appear live in many clubs in Greece.The uplifting scene in Greece has been silent for years, as very few tracks were produced in the late 2000s, but after 2010, Nitzhonot gained fame again, especially in Israel and partially in Greece, when a new Greek act called Magic Mizrahi appeared live at psy trance parties in Israel and other countries. Also old acts still appear live at underground parties in [[Athens]].

'''Ra√Ø'n'B''' (written '''Ra√Ø&amp;B''' and '''Ra√Ø/RnB''') is a musical genre that appeared in the 2000s in [[France]], with elements of both French contemporary [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and [[Algeria]]n [[Ra√Ø]].

The DJ duo [[Kore &amp; Scalp]] established the style and released the ground-breaking compilation album ''[[Ra√Ø'n'B (series)|Ra√Ø'n'B Fever]]'' in 2004 with the best examples of the genre that included [[Rap]], [[R&amp;B]] and [[Ra√Ø]]. Many further albums were released in the series in 2006 and 2008 (produced by Kore &amp; Bellek), 2009 special ''M√™me pas fatigu√©'' and Kore in 2011. Many of the tracks on the album ''Puissance Ra√Ø RnB 2012'' were produced by DJ Kim.

[[File:IKB 191.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Klein]], IKB 191, 1962, [[monochrome painting]]. Klein was a pioneer in the development of minimal art.]]

In the [[visual arts]] and [[Minimal music|music]], '''minimalism'''  is a style that uses pared-down design elements.

Minimalism in the arts began in post‚ÄìWorld War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minimalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[Modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

Minimalism in music features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe &quot;a 1913 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]] of a black square on a white ground&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as &quot;minimal art&quot;, &quot;literalist art&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. &quot;Art and Objecthood&quot;, ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;ABC Art&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. &quot;ABC Art&quot;, ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October‚ÄìNovember 1965): 57‚Äì69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at the [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and the [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 - June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, &quot;Engineer's Esthetic&quot;, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, &quot;The New Druids&quot;, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the [[art movement]] called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 Artforum essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name=&quot;sharecom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson minimalism was the result, even though the term &quot;minimalism&quot; was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this incorrect interpretation of what he said; Greenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me‚Äîor anyone at all‚Äîarriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharecom&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, &quot;Notes on Sculpture 1-3&quot;, originally published across three issues of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] - &quot;parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation.&quot; Morris later described an art represented by a &quot;marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals...&quot; in &quot;Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects&quot;, originally published in ''[[Artforum]]'', 1969, continuing on to say that &quot;indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing.&quot; The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early &quot;black paintings&quot; were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a &quot;given&quot; feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, &quot;Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting.&quot; These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, &quot;Specific Objects&quot; (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of &quot;preliminary&quot; importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticised by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its &quot;theatricality&quot;. In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in [[Artforum]] in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of [[Artforum]]. Smithson stated the following: &quot;What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing‚Äînamely being himself theatrical.&quot;

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} ISBN 978-0-520-07670-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 - Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann‚Äôs reaction was‚Äîone of the questions he asked Jackson was, &quot;Do you work from nature?&quot; There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson‚Äôs answer was, &quot;I am nature.&quot; And Hofmann‚Äôs reply was, &quot;Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself.&quot; To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements. Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]]. The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886‚Äì1969) adopted the motto &quot;Less is more&quot; to describe his aesthetic tactic of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity‚Äîhe enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895‚Äì1983) adopted the engineer's goal of &quot;Doing more with less&quot;, but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer [[Dieter Rams]]' motto, &quot;Less but better&quot;, adapted from Mies.

[[Luis Barrag√°n]] is another exemplary modern minimalist designer. Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design. More attractive minimalistic home designs are not truly minimalistic because these use more expensive building materials and finishes, and are larger.

Contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[√Ålvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. ISBN 82-547-0174-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8‚Äì11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rossell&quot;&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pawson&quot;&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‚Äòessences‚Äô are light, form, detail of material, space, place and human condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoni15-16&quot;&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15‚Äì16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. Moreover, they look deeply into the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to the details, people, space, nature and materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoni21&quot;&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; Which reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and search for the essence from those invisible qualities. Such as natural light, sky, earth and air. In addition, they open up dialogue with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rossell&quot;/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoni15-16&quot;/&gt; In late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement began to be popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‚Äòtruth to materials‚Äô, with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87‚Äì88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoni21&quot;/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}
The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85‚Äì97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217‚Äì224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pawson&quot;/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pawson&quot;/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities of materials and objects for the essence.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in Ryoanji temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. That removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space between interior and the exterior. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was influenced by the design element of Japanese sliding door that allows to bring the exterior to the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Mongabay.com [http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/japan/SOCIETY.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The emptiness of spatial arrangement is another idea that reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10‚Äì11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese &quot;MA&quot; |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96‚Äì106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando‚Äôs works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism.  Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees(2003)Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995‚Äì96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein‚Äôs ideas of fashion. John Pawson‚Äôs interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170‚Äì77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that client requested to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in the creation of a story, to &quot;choose sides&quot; based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than reacting to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel-inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term &quot;minimalism&quot; is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main|Minimal music}}

The term &quot;minimal music&quot; was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/833043|accessdate=11 January 2014}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer Hennig Christiansen, along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nagoya kei''' is an early subgenre of [[visual kei]], developed in the early-1990s music scene of [[Nagoya|Nagoya, Japan]]. Nagoya kei was a term that developed before the term visual kei, and gradually died out as the latter gained more popularity. This can be attributed to the fact that Nagoya kei, seems limited to Nagoya, when there were bands that played similar styles in other areas as well. Often considered darker and gloomier than visual kei, nagoya kei takes its musical influences more so from [[western world|western]] (specifically [[British people|British]]) [[punk rock]] bands. The focus of the bands tends to be much less on [[costume]] and [[makeup]] in favor of more complex musical compositions and concentration on the music itself. Notable nagoya kei bands include Silver~Rose, [[Laputa (band)|Laputa]], [[Fanatic Crisis]], [[Kuroyume]] and Merry Go Round.  Bands such as Kein, Lamiel, Phobia, [[Deadman (band)|Deadman]], Blast, Gullet, The Studs, [[Deathgaze]] and [[Lynch.]] appeared in the Nagoya area later on, but since the term Visual kei had already become mainstream by then, these bands are generally not considered part of Nagoya kei. Sometimes bands from Nagoya (no matter the era) are considered to be Nagoya kei, but this is rather uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=ÊúùÊó•Êñ∞ËÅûÔºàÊúùÂàä„ÉªÂêçÂè§Â±ãÔºâ|date=1999-03-19|page=21|title=„Éì„Ç∏„É•„Ç¢„É´Á≥ª„É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éê„É≥„Éâ‚ÄúÂêçÂè§Â±ãÁ≥ª‚Äù„ÄÅÂÖ®ÂõΩ„Å∏ÈÄ≤Âá∫|author=ÂùÇÊú¨ÁúüÂ≠ê}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- THE INTRODUCTION SHOULD BE CONCISE, AND DOESN'T NEED TO LIST EXAMPLES. IMPROVISATION IS SO WIDELY APPLICABLE THAT ANYTHING COULD BE INCLUDED SO AVOID TEMPTATION TO BE SPECIFIC OR TO PHILOSOPHISE WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE ARTICLE WHERE ONE CAN DO THAT--&gt;
'''Improvisation''' is the process of devising a solution to a requirement by making-do, despite absence of resources that might be expected to produce a solution. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation  as a context of performing arts is a very spontaneous performance without specific preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.

[[Musical improvisation]] is usually defined as the composition of music while simultaneously singing or playing an instrument. Improvisational comedy is a theatre art performed throughout the world and has had on-again, off-again status throughout history. [[Dance improvisation]] is frequently used as a [[choreography|choreographic]] tool. Choreography is also frequently used as a tool for improvisation. Improvisation was originally rarely used on dramatic television. A major exception was the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' where star [[Robin Williams]], famed for this kind of performing, was allotted specific sections in each episode where he was allowed to perform freely.

Improvisation also exists outside the arts. Improvisation in engineering is to solve a problem with the tools and materials immediately at hand. [[Improvised weapon]]s are often used by guerrillas, insurgents and criminals.

==Engineering==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Improvisation in engineering is to solve a problem with the tools and materials immediately at hand. Examples of such improvisation was the re-engineering of carbon dioxide scrubbers with the materials on hand during the [[Apollo 13]] space mission, or the use of a knife in place of a screwdriver to turn a screw.

[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62√ó51mm).]]
Engineering improvisations may be needed because of emergencies, [[embargo]], [[obsolescence]] of a product and the loss of manufacturer support, or just a lack of funding appropriate for a better solution. Users of motor vehicles in parts of Africa develop improvised solutions where it is not feasible to obtain manufacturer-approved spare parts.

The popular television program [[MacGyver]] used as its gimmick a hero who could solve almost any problem with [[jury rig]]ged devices from everyday materials, a Swiss Army knife and some [[duct tape]].

==Performing arts==

Improvisation can be thought of as an &quot;on the spot&quot; or &quot;off the cuff&quot; spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind, body and spirit as an inspiration. No preparation or training is needed. However, improvisation in any life or art form, can occur more often if it is practiced as a way of encouraging creative behavior. That practice includes learning to use one's [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], as well as learning a technical understanding of the necessary skills and concerns within the domain in which one is improvising. This can be when an individual or group is acting, dancing, singing, playing [[musical instrument]]s, talking, creating artworks, problem solving, or reacting in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one's immediate environment and inner feelings. This can result in the invention of new thought patterns, new practices, new structures or symbols, and/or new ways to act.

==Skills and techniques==
The skills of improvisation can apply to many different abilities or forms of communication and expression across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. For example, improvisation can make a significant contribution in music, dance, cooking, presenting a speech, sales, personal or romantic relationships, sports, flower arranging, martial arts, psychotherapy, and much more.

Techniques of improvisation are widely used in training for performing arts or entertainment; for example, music, theatre and dance. To &quot;''extemporize''&quot; or &quot;ad lib&quot; is basically the same as improvising. Colloquial terms such as &quot;let's play it by the ear&quot;, &quot;take it as it comes&quot;, and &quot;make it up as we go along&quot; are all used to describe &quot;improvisation&quot;.

The simple act of speaking requires a good deal of improvisation because the mind is addressing its own thought and creating its unrehearsed delivery in words, sounds and gestures, forming unpredictable statements that feed back into the thought process (the performer as listener), creating an enriched process that is not unlike instantaneous composition [with a given set or repertoire of elements].&lt;ref&gt;''The Speech Chain: The Physics and Biology of Spoken Language'' (paperback), Peter B. Denes and Elliot N. Pinson. 1966. Worth Publishers; Second Edition (February 15, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the improvisation is intended to solve a problem on a temporary basis, the &quot;proper&quot; solution being unavailable at the time, it may be known as a &quot;stop-gap&quot;. This applies to the field of engineering. Another improvisational, group problem-solving technique being used in organizations of all kinds is '''brainstorming''', in which any and all ideas that a group member may have are permitted and encouraged to be expressed, regardless of actual practicality. As in all improvisation, the process of brainstorming opens up the minds of the people involved to new, unexpected and possibly useful ideas. The colloquial term for this is &quot;thinking outside the box.&quot;

==Music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}

Improvisation is usually defined as the composition of music while simultaneously singing or playing an instrument. In other words, the art of improvisation can be understood as composing music &quot;on the fly&quot;. Improvisation can take place as a solo performance, or interdependently in ensemble with other players. When done well, it often elicits gratifying emotional responses from the audience. One notable improvisational pianist is [[Franz Liszt]]. The origins of Liszt's improvisation in an earlier tradition of playing variations on a theme were mastered and epitomized by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].

Notable improvisational musicians from the modern era include: [[Keith Jarrett]], an improvisational jazz pianist and multi-instrumentalist who has performed many completely improvised concerts all over the world; [[W. A. Mathieu]] aka William Allaudin Mathieu, was the musical director for [[the Second City]] in Chicago, the first on-going improvisational theatre troupe in the United States, and later was musical director for another improv theatre, [[the Committee (improv group)]], an offshoot of the Second City in San Francisco. [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], an improvisational guitarist, [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]], an improvisational violinist, and [[Eugene Friesen]], an improvisational cellist.

Improvised [[freestyle rap]] is commonly practiced as a part of [[rappers]]' creative processes, as a &quot;finished product&quot; for release on recordings (when the improvisation is judged good enough), as a spiritual event, as a means of verbal combat in [[battle rap]], and, simply, for fun. It often incorporates insults similar to those in the African-American game [[The Dozens]], and complex rhythmic and sometimes melodic forms comparable to those heard in jazz improvisation.

In the realm of [[silent film]] music, there are also a small number of musicians whose work has been recognized as exceptional by critics, scholars and audiences alike; these include [[Neil Brand]] and [[John Sweeney (pianist)|John Sweeney]], among others who are all performers at &quot;Le Giornate del Cinema Muto&quot;, the annual conference on silent film in Pordenone, Italy. Their performances must match the style and pacing of those films which they accompany and the knowledge of a wide range of musical styles is required, as well as the stamina to play for films which occasionally run more than three hours in length, without a pause.

=== Comedy ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{Main|Improvisational theatre}}

Improvisational comedy is a theatre art performed throughout the world and has had on-again, off-again status throughout history.

Some of the more famous improv theatres and training centers in the world include: [[IO Theater|i.O.]] (formerly ImprovOlympic) in Chicago and Los Angeles, [[The Second City]] in Chicago and [[Toronto]], [[The Players Workshop]] in Chicago, [[National Comedy Theatre]] in San Diego, New York and Phoenix, [[Upright Citizens Brigade]], the [[Peoples Improv Theater]], the [[Magnet Theater]], the [[Groundlings]], [[BATS Improv]] (Bay Area Theatre Sports) in San Francisco, [[Wing-It Productions]] in [[Seattle]], [[Philly Improv Theater]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Brave New Workshop]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], and [[Theatresports]] in [[Calgary]], Canada.

There are also many well known university improv teams, including [[Theatre Strike Force]] at the [[University of Florida]], Gigglepants at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and [[Erasable Inc.]] at the [[University of Maryland]]. Improvisation found a home at universities. The origins of [[the Second City]] was the [[Compass Players]], an offshoot of theatre programs at the [[University of Chicago]] in the 50's. Later, once improv had been established as an art form, improv groups sprung up on college campuses, starting in the 80's where crowds were easy to find and teams could perform frequently. Now an improv group is a common staple of college extra curricular activities.

Notable pioneers in the field of improvisation, comedic or otherwise, include [[Mike Myers]], [[Neil Mullarkey]], [[Paul Merton]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[John Sessions]], [[Josie Lawrence]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Paul Sills]], [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], [[Del Close]], [[Josephine Forsberg]], [[Gary Austin]], [[Martin de Maat]], and [[Keith Johnstone]]. Notable performers include: [[Paul Merton]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], [[Colin Mochrie]], [[Ryan Stiles]], [[Ross Noble]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Tony Slattery]], [[Mike McShane]], [[Sandi Toksvig]], [[Wayne Brady]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[T. J. Jagodowski]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[David Pasquesi]].

===Dance===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Dance improvisation]] as a [[choreography|choreographic]] tool: Improvisation is used as a choreographic tool in [[dance composition]]. Experimenting with the concepts of shape, space, time, and energy while moving without inhibition or cognitive thinking can create unique and innovative movement designs, spatial configuration, dynamics, and unpredictable rhythms. Improvisation without inhibition allows the choreographer to connect to their deepest creative self, which in turn clears the way for pure invention.

[[Contact improvisation]]: a form developed in 1973, that is now practiced around the world. Contact improvisation originated from the movement studies of Steve Paxton in the 1970s and developed through the continued exploration of the [[Judson Dance Theater]]. It is a dance form based on weight sharing, partnering, playing with weight, exploring negative space and unpredictable outcomes.

==Sculpture==
Sculpture often relies on the enlargement of a small model or [[maquette]] to create the final work in a chosen material. Where the material is ''plastic'' such as [[clay]], a working structure or [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] often needs to be built to allow the pre-determined design to be realized. [[Alan Thornhill]]'s method for working with clay abandons the maquette,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2uNhbq6mk4 Alan Thornhill on the tradition of pre-conceiving sculpture 1989 studio archive footage], [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; seeing it as ''ultimately deadening to creativity''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanthornhill.co.uk/Spirit%20in%20Mass%20film.htm Film: Spirit in Mass ‚Äì Journey into Sculpture (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; Without the restrictions of the armature, a clay matrix of elements allows that when recognisable forms start to emerge, they can be essentially disregarded by turning the work, allowing for infinite possibility and the chance for the unforeseen to emerge more powerfully at a later stage.

Moving from ''adding and taking away'' to purely reductive working, the architectural considerations of turning the work are eased considerably but continued removal of material through the rejection of forms deemed ''too obvious'' can mean one ends up with nothing. Former pupil [[Jon Edgar]] uses Thornhill's method as a creative extension to [[direct carving]] in stone and wood.

== Film ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The director [[Mike Leigh]] uses lengthy improvisations developed over a period of weeks to build characters and story lines for his films. He starts with some sketch ideas of how he thinks things might develop but does not reveal all his intentions with the cast who discover their fate and act out their responses as their destinies are gradually revealed, including significant aspects of their lives which will not subsequently be shown onscreen. The final filming draws on dialogue and actions that have been recorded during the improvisation period.

The film company [[ACT 2 CAM]] uses improvisation to create the characters, contexts and plot for their films. Improvisation also forms a large part of the final filmed product.

==Writing==
Improvisational writing is an exercise that imposes limitations on a writer such as a time limit, word limit, a specific topic, or rules on what can be written. This forces the writer to work within [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] and write without judgment of the work they produce. This technique is used for a variety of reasons, such as to bypass [[writer's block]], improve creativity, strengthen one's writing instinct and enhance one's flexibility in writing.

Some improvisational writing is collaborative, focusing on an almost [[dadaist]] form of [[collaborative fiction]]. This can take a variety of forms, from as basic as passing a notebook around a circle of writers with each writing a sentence, to coded environments that focus on collaborative novel-writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harrigan | first = Pat | title = First person: new media as story, performance, and game | publisher = MIT Press| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0-262-23232-6| pages = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; like ''[[OtherSpace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Platt | first = Wes | authorlink = Wes Platt| title = OtherSpace: End of the World, Arcs IV‚ÄìV| publisher = [[iUniverse]]| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0595230464| pages = ix‚Äìx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Improvised weapon]]s are often used by guerrillas, insurgents and criminals as conventional weapons may be unavailable. Such weapons vary in sophistication from simple sharpened sticks, to petrol bombs and homemade napalm, to [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and makeshift [[bomber]] aircraft. Weapons are also improvised by regular military organizations and formations as &quot;stop-gap&quot; measures when purpose-built equipment is either not on hand or is simply not yet available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8463">The '''orchestral song''' (German ''{{Lang|de|Orchesterlied}}'') is a [[romanticism|late romantic]] genre of [[classical music]] for solo voices and orchestra.

==History==
What was effectively song with instrumental accompaniment ‚Äì the [[cantata]] and the aria ‚Äì had been part of music since the early baroque. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] too had occasionally provided instrumental accompaniment to some songs. Full orchestration, to enable a song to &quot;hold its own&quot; in a 19th-century concert environment, developed from the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Song Cycle'', p. 64, Laura Tunbridge (2011). &quot;The orchestral song has a complicated genealogy. There were ... In order to hold their own against the larger-scale works, Lieder needed to be amplified; automatically achieved through the addition of instrumental accompaniment. This would ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest experiments with orchestral song are those of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] who orchestrated several of his songs in the 1840s but did not publish them. Liszt also had the operetta composer [[August Conradi]] orchestrate his ''Le juif errant'' and ''Jeanne d'Arc'' around 1848, but these too were neither published nor performed. Long after Berlioz' publication of his orchestrations of ''[[Les nuits d'√©t√©]]'' in 1856, Liszt finally published his own orchestration of ''Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher,'' as a dramatic scene for voice and orchestra in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;''The Liszt Companion'', p. 433, Ben Arnold (2002). &quot;Szitha concluded, &quot;Though Le juif errant was never published and Jeanne d'Arc only in a late 1874 variant, the two pieces bear out that back in the latter half of the 1840s Liszt was already experimenting with the genre of the orchestral song.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''German Lieder in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 299. Rufus E. Hallmark (2010). &quot;It is often said that with the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen Mahler established the genre of the orchestral song cycle, but it was an idea whose time was certainly ripe, ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The form was brought to fruition by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], to the extent that it is difficult to say where Mahler's symphonies end and where his symphonic songs begin.&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Symphony playbill'', San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (1999). &quot;The genre of the orchestral song came into vogue throughout Europe in the years just before the turn of the century. Mahler, who gave such compositions the full stature of symphonic movements, provides the most spectacular examples, but French composers were quite as enthusiastic. Often their melodies were composed all-but-simultaneously in two ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single orchestral songs==
The genre of orchestral song tends to longer programmed pieces than songs accompanied by piano. For this reason the orchestral song may be either be a longer single song or, more commonly, a [[Song cycle|cycle]]. An example of a single long song text is found in [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Luonnotar (Sibelius)|Luonnotar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Jean Sibelius'', p. 311, Tomi M√§kel√§ (2011). &quot;Sibelius' sole significant contribution to the orchestral song ‚Äì a fashionable genre at the turn of the century, prominently represented by Gustav Mahler ‚Äì was Luonnotar. a setting of erik Johan Stagnelius' 'Serenad' for baritone and orchestra &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]'s ''Den Bergtekne'', op. 32. [[Hugo Wolf]] scored twenty-four of his songs for voice and orchestra, including ''Prometheus''. The genre of the story-telling cantata continues alongside the orchestral song, as [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s [[cantata]] ''Le bal masqu√©'' and ''[[La voix humaine]]'', a one-act [[opera]] for one character.

==Orchestral song cycles==
[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]' own [[orchestration]]s of his ''[[Les nuits d'√©t√©]]'' [[song cycle]] (1841) into orchestral songs (1856) are often regarded as the &quot;first orchestral song cycle,&quot; though others consider it the first well known progenitor of the orchestral song.&lt;ref&gt;''The Song Cycle'', p. 64, Laura Tunbridge (2011). &quot;This would be one way to explain the genesis of what is sometimes called the first orchestral song cycle, but is perhaps better seen as one of its progenitors: Hector Berlioz's Les Nuits d'√©t√© (Summer Nights), composed for voice and piano in ..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Nineteenth-Century Music'', p. 164, Jim Samson (2001). &quot;These songs were later orchestrated, and are sometimes claimed as the first orchestral song cycle.10 Berlioz's achievement, even in the original versions with piano, was to integrate poem, voice and instruments into a homogeneous texture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples in France include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s second work entitled ''[[Sh√©h√©razade]]'', a song cycle after three poems by Tristan Klingsor: Asie, La fl√ªte enchant√©e, and L'indiff√©rent (1903) and his cycle ''Don Quichotte √† Dulcin√©e'', and [[Ernest Chausson|Chausson]]'s ''[[Po√®me de l'amour et de la mer]]''. Later examples include orchestral songs by [[Jean Cras]] and [[Jacques Ibert]]'s ''4 Chansons de Don Quichotte''.

Notable examples of the orchestral song cycle in Germany and Austria include [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Vier letzte Lieder]]'' and several cycles by [[Gustav Mahler]]: ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]], [[Des Knaben Wunderhorn (Mahler)|Des Knaben Wundernhorn]]; [[Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen]]''; and ''[[Kindertotenlieder]]''. These models were influential on [[Alma Mahler-Werfel]], [[Alexander von Zemlinsky|Zemlinsky]], [[Joseph Marx]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Max Reger]], [[Othmar Schoeck]], [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], and [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]]: ''{{Lang|de|6 Monologe aus Jedermann}}''. [[Paul von Klenau]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Kornetts Christoph Rilke}}'' (1918) and ''{{Lang|de|Gespr√§che mit dem Tod}}''.

Aside from [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] Scandinavian examples include [[Ture Rangstr√∂m]]'s Swedish cycle ''H√§xorna'' (&quot;The Witches&quot;) (1938) ''Den Utvalda'' (&quot;The Chosen&quot;), [[Leevi Madetoja|Madetoja]]'s ''Syksy-sarja'' (Autumn Song Cycle), [[Selim Palmgren]]'s ''En s√§llsam f√•gel'' (a lonely bird) and ''Aamun autereessa'' (in the morning mist), Danish composer [[Peter Lange-M√ºller]]'s orchestrations of his songs, and [[Erik Norby]]'s ''Rilke-Lieder'' for mezzo-soprano and orchestra.

In Slavic lands examples include Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestrations of Musorgsky's four ''[[Songs and Dances of Death]]'', [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s orchestral song cycles, such as ''[[From Jewish Folk Poetry]]'', Romances on words by Japanese poets, ''[[Suite on Verses of Michelangelo Buonarroti]]'' (1974), also ‚Äì to an extent ‚Äì his [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Thirteenth &quot;Babi Yar&quot;]] (1962) and [[Symphony No. 14 (Shostakovich)|Fourteenth]] Symphonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Musorgsky, in memoriam, 1881‚Äì1981'', p. 221, Malcolm Hamrick Brown (1982). &quot;Shostakovich's late style has been characterized as austere, economical, sparse, and &quot;archaic&quot;-sounding. ... works such as the Thirteenth (1962) and Fourteenth Symphonies can be perceived more readily as orchestral song cycles, than as .&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski (musician)|W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski]] and [[Karol Szymanowski]] in Polish, and in Czech [[Bohuslav Martin≈Ø|Martin≈Ø]]'s ''Magic Nights'' and ''Nipponari''.&lt;ref&gt;''Martin≈Ø and the Symphony'', p. 462, Michael Crump (2010). &quot;In 1932, Martin≈Ø received a request from the singer Magdalena MateÀájovsk√° for a song from his early orchestral song-cycle Magic Nights. He reworked the central number from the cycle for alto and piano, transposing it down a fourth and ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In British and American music examples of orchestral song cycles include [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s cycles ''Nocturne'' (1958) ''Les Illuminations'' and ''Our Hunting Fathers''.  [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] contributed the orchestration of his ''[[On Wenlock Edge]]'', originally for voice, piano and optional string quartet.  Other English orchestral songs include those by [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Hubert Parry]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], [[Gerald Finzi|Finzi]], [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]], as well as posthumous orchestrations of [[Ivor Gurney]]'s songs in arrangements by Gerald Finzi and Herbert Howells.

{{Listen|filename=David Popper - Elfentanz (Hans Goldstein, cello).ogg|title=&quot;Elfentanz&quot;|description=A perpetuum mobile for cello and piano by [[David Popper]], consisting of continuous spiccato; Hans Goldstein ({{H:title|Yep, a cello|cello}}) and Mellicia Straaf (piano).}}
In music '''''perpetuum mobile''''' ([[Latin]], English pronunciation /p…ôÀêÀåp…õtj ä…ôm Ààm…ô äb…™le…™, Ààm…ô äb…™li), '''''moto perpetuo''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), '''''mouvement perp√©tuel''''' ([[French language|French]]), ''''movimento perp√©tuo'''' ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) '''''movimiento perpetuo''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), literally meaning &quot;perpetual motion&quot;, has two distinct meanings: pieces of [[music]], or parts of pieces, characterised by a continuous steady stream of notes, usually at a rapid [[tempo]], or whole pieces, or large parts of pieces, which are to be played repeatedly, often an indefinite number of times.

==As separate compositions==
[[Image:Chopin sonata2 finale.svg|thumb|550px|A well-known example as a technique is the presto finale of [[Fr√©d√©ric Chopin]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]]:'' This figuration of rapid triplet quavers (eighth notes) continues for the duration of the movement.]]
As a separate piece, a &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; can be defined as a composition where (a large part of) the piece is intended to be repeated an (often not specified) number of times, without the &quot;motion&quot; of the melody being halted when a repeat begins. [[Canon (music)|Canon]]s are often intended to be performed in a ''moto perpetuo'' fashion (which, in that case, can be called ''canon perpetuus'').

In some cases the repeats of a &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot; piece are at a different pitch (while a [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] or a [[chord progression]] occurs during the repeatable part): some of the ''riddle canons'' of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Das Musikalische Opfer]] are examples of this particular kind of Perpetuum Mobile/Canon Perpetuus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

''Perpetuum mobile'' as a [[Music genre|genre]] of separate musical compositions was at the height of its popularity by the end of the 19th century. Such pieces would often be performed as virtuoso [[encore (concert)|encore]]s, in some cases increasing the tempo along the repeats.

==Examples==
&quot;Perpetuum mobile&quot; pieces of both kinds include:

'''Shaabi''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿâ}}'' {{transl|ar|ALA|Sha ªbƒ´}}''&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|Àà É√¶ ïbi|pron}}) is an [[Egypt]]ian musical genre. It is a form of popular working-class music which evolved from [[baladi]] in the second half of the 20th century.

Shaabi literally means 'music of the people'. It originated in Cairo in the 1970s, as a new form of urban music expressing the difficulties and frustrations of modern Egyptian life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop Culture Arab World!&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Pop Culture Arab World!|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-449-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaabi lyrics can be both intensely political, and filled with humour and double entendre. Because of its nature as street music, and a widespread indifference to copyright law among Egyptians, Shaabi today is mainly distributed on pirated tapes and CDs.

The first shaabi singer to rise to stardom was [[Ahmed Adaweyah]], whose first album in 1972 sold a million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop Culture Arab World!&quot; /&gt; Like many shaabi singers, Adaweyah was famed for his [[mawwal]]. 
More recently, [[Shaaban Abdel Rahim]] rose to fame in 2000 with the controversial 'Ana Bakra Israel' ('I hate Israel'), and has remained something of a working-class hero due to a string of populist political hits.

Other well-known singers in the shaabi genre include [[Saad al-Soghayer]], [[Amina (Egyptian Singer)|Amina]], and [[Abdelbaset Hamouda]]. Another notable singer is [[Hakim (Egyptian singer)|Hakim]], who is from a middle-class background unlike most shaabi singers, and whose commercially successful brand of shaabi-pop is generally cheerful and apolitical.

The most recent new development to come out of Cairo's Shaabi scene is '[[mahraganat]]' ('festivals'; {{lang-ar|ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿßÿ™}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|m…ëh.…æ…ë.…°…ëÀàn…ëÀêt|}}) music, also known as 'electro-shaabi'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Out of Egypt‚Äôs Chaos, Musical Rebellion&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hubbard|first=Ben|title=Out of Egypt‚Äôs Chaos, Musical Rebellion|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/world/middleeast/egypts-chaos-stirs-musical-revolution.html|newspaper=New York TImes|date=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known artists in this genre are [[Oka Wi Ortega]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/OkaWiOrtega&lt;/ref&gt; Filo, Sadat, and Fifty. The genre was popularised in the by alternative culture magazine ''[[Audio Kultur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://audiokultur.com/electrochaabi/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Cairo Liberation Front]]'' and by the blog ''[[Generation Bass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.generationbass.com/2012/10/18/arabia-rising-egyptian-electro-chaabi/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Divertimento''''' {{IPAc-en|d|…®|Àå|v|…úr|t|…®|Àà|m|…õ|n|t|o ä}} ({{IPA-it|divertiÀàmento|lang}}; from the Italian ''[[Wikt:divertire|divertire]]'' &quot;to amuse&quot;) is a musical genre, with most of its examples from the 18th century. The mood of the ''[[Wikt:divertimento|divertimento]]'' is most often lighthearted (as a result of being played at social functions) and it is generally composed for a small [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]].

''Divertimento'' is used to describe a wide variety of secular instrumental works for soloist or chamber ensemble. It is a kind of music entertainment although it could also be applied to serious genres. After 1780, the term generally designated works that were informal or light.

As a separate genre, it appears to have no specific form, although most of the ''divertimenti'' of the second half of the 18th century go either back to a dance [[Suite (music)|suite]] approach (derived from the 'ballet' type of theatrical ''divertimento''), or take the form of other [[chamber music]] genres of their century (as a continuation of the merely instrumental theatrical ''divertimento''). There are many other terms which describe music similar to the ''divertimento'', including ''[[serenade]]'', ''[[cassation (music)|cassation]]'', ''notturno'', ''Nachtmusik''; after about 1780, the ''divertimento'' was the term most commonly applied to this light, &quot;after-dinner&quot; and often outdoor music. ''Divertimenti'' have from one to nine [[Movement (music)|movements]], and there is at least one example with thirteen. The earliest publication to use the name &quot;''divertimento''&quot; is by [[Carlo Grossi]] in 1681 in Venice (''Il divertimento de' grandi: musiche da camera, √≤ per servizio di tavola'') and the hint that the ''divertimento'' is to accompany &quot;table service&quot; applies to later ages as well, since this light music was often used to accompany banquets and other social events.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] is known for having composed different types of ''divertimenti'', sometimes even taking the form of a small [[symphony]] (or, more exactly: [[sinfonia]]), for example, the ''Salzburg Symphonies'' K. 136, K. 137 and K. 138. Even more unusual is his six movement [[string trio]], the [[Divertimento in E-flat (Mozart)|Divertimento in E-flat, K. 563]], which is a serious work belonging with his [[string quartet]]s and [[String quintet|quintets]], despite it being labeled a ''divertimento''. Other composers of ''divertimenti'' include [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Carl Stamitz]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]].

Several examples exist from the 20th century, including works by [[Alfred Reed]], [[Nikolai Medtner]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[B√©la Bart√≥k]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Paul Graener]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Lennox Berkeley]], [[Gareth Walters]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Lars-Erik Larsson]], [[Saint-Preux]] and [[Bohuslav Martin≈Ø]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]] also arranged a divertimento from his ballet to music of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], ''[[Le baiser de la f√©e]]'', while [[Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo]] called his 1982 [[cello concerto]] a &quot;[[Concierto como un divertimento]]&quot; (&quot;Concerto like a divertimento&quot;).

[[File:CALLE13-residente-NuevaYork-2006.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Residente'' from [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]], the premier exponent of alternative reggaeton]]

'''Alternative reggaeton''' is a subgenre of [[reggaeton]] that emerged from the [[hip hop]] movement as a reaction to its repetitive and monotone dembow rhythm, and the predominant stereotypical gangsta content that became predictable. The result was a complex sound derived from world sounds, mainly rooted in [[Latin America]]n folk music such as [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] y [[plena]], [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[tango music|tango]] and also other foreign influenced music such as [[Rock en Espa√±ol|rock en espa√±ol]]. Mixed with thoughtful (and sometimes crude) lyricism guided by an [[anti-colonialism]] discourse, Latin American sociopolitical content and racial pride, it gave listeners a smooth blend of danceable rhythms and intellectual dialogue.

==History==
The precursor is arguably one of the founding fathers of reggaeton: [[Vico C]], whose albums relied heavily on hip hop acoustics, keyboards and reggae roots. ''[[Xplosi√≥n]]'' (1993),  ''[[Aquel Que Hab√≠a Muerto]]'' (1998) and ''[[Desahogo (Vico C album)|Desahogo]]'' (2005) are good examples.

==Rise of a new sound==
The starting point of alternative reggaeton ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' is considered by many to be the album ''[[El Abayarde]]'', the 2002 debut of [[Tego Calder√≥n]]. The blend of Puerto Rican folk music, known as [[Rafael Cepeda|bomba y plena]] (derived from its African ancestry of [[Loiza]]), and a steady beats of hip hop and classical reggaeton served as a base for the new variant. The album became a major success, launching the underground status of Calder√≥n to the pinnacle of the Spanish speaking [[MC]]'s.

==Breakthrough==
The breakthrough album of what is considered alternative reggaeton came in 2005 with the [[Calle 13 (album)|self-titled debut album]] of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] duo [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]].  The song &quot;[[Atr√©vete-te-te]]&quot; from the album became a big success on the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, peaking at #15.&lt;ref&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=calle 13|chart=all}} Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Calle 13]&lt;/ref&gt; This helped the genre gain more media exposure. The background of the Puerto Rican duo provided a fresh source for the subgenre.  Producer and multi-instrumentalist Visitante was formerly educated in music, and eventually formed part of a [[Rock en Espa√±ol|rock en espa√±ol]] and Brazilian [[batucada]] band called Bayanga, which provided a diametrical point of view from the traditional ''[[caserio|caser√≠o]]{{dn|date=January 2013}}''-inspired [[dancehall]] synthesizer sound from most albums. Lyricist Residente was highly educated, having earned a [[Masters of Fine Arts]] in the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p747326|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to his crafted lyricism and purposeful sarcasm. The main asset of the album was that it provided more than just danceable tracks, and it began to question the inner perception of Puerto Rican identity and the acceptance of foreign models as a pertinent solution to Latin American issues. This is evident in the [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] mocking song &quot;[[Calle 13 (album)|Pi-di-di-di]]&quot;. Some criticism has been raised of Residente by its close similarity to [[Eminem]]'s songs and whole '[[wikt:enfant terrible|enfant terrible]]' [[ethos]].

The sophomore and junior album of the band have further expanded this realm creating a mature product that provides sexual discussions and ethical questioning. For this reason the band has achieve critical success winning multiple accolades including five [[Grammys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Negr√≥n-Muntaner|Negr√≥n-Muntaner, Frances]]; Chapter ''Poetry of Filth: The (Post) Reggaetonic Lyrics of Calle 13'' from book ''Reggaeton''; Duke University Press, NC; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also purposely distanced themselves from other rappers in their appearance by using simple tropical clothes with bright colors, and ''pucas'' (a good-luck charm necklace made by local craftsman) instead of the [[bling-bling]] persona derived from American rappers and completely decontextualized from the warm climate of the [[Caribbean]].

==Other exponents==
Much like the alternative wing of hip hop (with artists such as [[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]), both Tego Calder√≥n and Calle 13 have found a solid fan-base and success in the indie scene and mainstream scenarios. But other artists such as 7-9 (sometimes referred to as [[SieteNueve]]) and [[Intifada (rapper)|Intifada]] still remain relatively unknown. Although their content is deliberately Nationalistic and completely in Spanish, much like the other alternative artists, they do not consider themselves reggaeton singers, but hip-hoppers. The only track to receive some airplay in major stations was 7-9's &quot;[[Ed√∫cate o Qu√©date Calla'o]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Torres, Jaime; Article: ''Tapaboca a Daddy Yankee'',  Newspaper El Nuevo Dia, Puerto Rico; http://www.elnuevodia.com/diario/noticia/musica/flash!/tapaboca_a_yankee&lt;/ref&gt; a dissed track against [[Daddy Yankee]] arguing that his support to Sen. [[John McCain]] in the USA primaries was inappropriate and was setting a bad example for the youth. Another artist somewhat associated to the subgenre is producer [[Danny Fornaris]], due to his protest track &quot;[[Querido FBI]]&quot;, whom Calle 13 wrote in honor of [[Boricua Popular Army|Machetero]] leader [[Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os]] after he was allegedly assassinated by the [[FBI]]. However, Fornaris' constant collaborations with mainstream reggaeton singers, such as [[Don Omar]] and [[Tito El Bambino]], has devaluated him in the indie scene, contributing to a [[sellout]] stigma.

'''Banjo Music''' is a genre of music that consists exclusively, or primarily of, the [[banjo]]. Banjo music can be played as a solo, or it can be played with a band. Banjo music can be played with all types of banjos (four, five, or six string).

==History==
Banjo music originated informally as a form of African folk music over a hundred years ago probably in the sub-Saharan region. When the Americans forced African slaves to work on the plantations, banjo music followed them, and stayed primarily a form of African folk music, up to the 1800s. In that time period, [[White American|white americans]] did observe the instrument of its music but seemed to take no large interest until the occurrence of grotesque representations of black culture by white performers in minstrel shows. It was during this time that the banjo in all probability was first introduced to Ireland, when the Virginia Minstrels toured in England, Ireland and France in 1843, 1844 and 1845. With his minstrel shows, Joel Walker Sweeney is credited with extending the popularity of the banjo as well as its music to an enormous audience all over the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standingstones.com/banjo.html. &quot;The Banjo - A Short History by Mick Moloney&quot;. Retrieved 8/12/2013
&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spread of popularity of the banjo, it influenced different kinds of music - it gave rise to mountain string bands, and even helped give a foundation for Blues music. The occurrences of hootenannies gave a house to banjo music, where it made its place in American folk music and Bluegrass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/arscurry/banjo-in-american-folk-music. &quot;Banjo in American Folk Music. Retrieved 8/12/13&lt;/ref&gt; American television shows such as [[Hee Haw]] have made banjo music all the more popular, and more a part of American culture.

Unlike most other solo music pieces played by various instruments, banjo music does not only consist of a melody, but it also utilizes drone notes to make the music seem like it is being played by more than one instrument. While very basic compositions will consist of only melodies, more complicated pieces will have multiple drone notes, usually organized in a predictable roll pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Trischka - &quot;The Complete 5-string banjo player&quot;, Oak Publications, New York.

&lt;/ref&gt; Banjo music tends to be very lively and upbeat, as the fast-occurring drone notes tend to give the illusion that a song is being played quite fast. Banjo music is not usually amplified (except by aid of a microphone), as the banjo's resonator allows it to be played quite loud.

'''Ambient industrial''' is a [[post-industrial music]] genre that makes use of industrial principles such as [[Noise music|noise]] and shock tactics, but wields these elements with more subtlety. Additionally, ambient industrial often has strong [[occultist]] tendencies, with a particular leaning toward [[Chaos magic|Chaos Magick]] (the image of the [[Black Sun (alchemy)|Black Sun]] is one that comes up repeatedly in post-industrial music), often giving the music a highly ritualistic flavor. 

Ambient industrial is one of several directions that post-industrial music took on after the breakup of [[Throbbing Gristle]] (the founders of [[Industrial (music)|industrial]] as an art movement) in 1981 ended the industrial period proper. Indeed, the last material that TG recorded, at least in the studio, ''Journey Through a Body'' and ''In the Shadow of the Sun'', was ambient industrial work and pointed to the direction that several of TG's offshoots (most notably Coil and CTI) would take.

Among the many artists who work in this area are [[Coil (band)|Coil]], [[Chris &amp; Cosey|CTI]], [[Lab Report]], [[Lustmord]], [[Hafler Trio]], [[Nocturnal Emissions]], [[Zoviet France]], [[Poison Gas Research|PGR]], [[Akira Yamaoka]],  [[Thomas K√∂ner]], [[Controlled Bleeding]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] (''[[Ghosts I‚ÄìIV]]''), [[Techno Animal]] (early), [[Robin Rimbaud]], [[Der Blutharsch]], [[Final (band)|Final]] and [[Deutsch Nepal]]. It is important to note, however, that many of these artists are very [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]] in their output, with much of it falling outside of ambient industrial.

A &quot;typical&quot; ambient industrial work may consist of evolving [[dissonant]] harmonies of metallic [[Drone (music)|drones]] and [[resonance]]s, extreme low frequency rumbles and machine noises, perhaps supplemented by gongs, [[percussive]] [[rhythms]], [[bullroarers]], distorted voices and/or anything else the artist might care to sample (often processed to the point where the original sample is no longer recognizable). Entire works may be based on [[radio telescope]] recordings (Arecibo ''Trans-Plutonian Transmissions''), the babbling of newborn babies (Nocturnal Emissions ''Mouths of Babes''), or sounds recorded through [[contact microphone]]s on [[telegraph]] wires ([[Alan Lamb (musician)|Alan Lamb]]'s ''Primal Image'').

==Subgenres and related styles==
===Ambient noise===
Ambient noise is a subgenre involving the construction of &quot;noisescapes&quot;, that is, soundscapes created out of walls of extreme noise. Closely related to [[noise music]] and [[List of post-industrial music genres and related fusion genres#Power electronics|power electronics]], this anti-music may not strike the uninitiated listener as being very close to ambient music. To those more familiar with noise, these works have a distinct ambient quality that distinguishes them from the harsh noise of [[Merzbow]] or [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]]. An example would be the distorted low-frequency/high-volume sonics of [[Daniel Menche]], which are evocative of the cthonic sounds of a subway tunnel, an underground boiler-room in a factory, or the afterburner of a jet engine. Other examples of ambient noise would be works by [[Aube (band)|Aube]], [[Arcane Device]], some work by [[Boyd Rice]], and some of PGR's collaborations with noise artists like Merzbow.

[[Ernest Hogan]] (1865‚Äì1909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called &quot;LA Pas Ma LA&quot; and it was  released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term ''ragtime''. The term is actually derived from his hometown &quot;Shake Rag &quot; in Bowling Green, Kentucky. [[Ben Harney]], who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition &quot;You've been a good old wagon but you done broke&quot; helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;rb1&quot;&gt;Blesh, Rudi. ''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist, Introduction to Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works'', New York Public Library, 1981, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brogan, Hugh. ''The Penguin History of the USA'', 2nd Edition, 1999, ISBN 978-0-14-025255-2, p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; Ragtime was also a modification of the [[March (music)|march]] made popular by [[John Philip Sousa]], with additional [[polyrhythm]]s coming from African music.&lt;ref name=&quot;rb2&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', pp. xv‚Äìxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]] (''ca.'' 1868‚Äì1917) became famous through the publication of the &quot;[[Maple Leaf Rag]]&quot; (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as &quot;[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]&quot; (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rb3&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rb4&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; For at least 12 years after its publication, &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its [[melody]] lines, [[Harmony|harmonic progressions]] or [[Meter (music)|metric patterns]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rb5&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ragtime fell out of favor as [[jazz]] claimed the public's imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since the music has been re-discovered. First in the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78 rpm records]]. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. In 1971 [[Joshua Rifkin]] brought out a compilation of Joplin's work which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Past Winner Database&quot;&gt;[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1971/1971grammy.htm Past Winner Database], &quot;1971 14th Grammy Awards.&quot; Accessed Feb. 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 [[The New England Ragtime Ensemble]] (then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble) recorded ''The Red Back Book'', a compilation of some of Joplin's rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president [[Gunther Schuller]]. This also won a Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Top Classical Album of 1974. Subsequently, the motion picture ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973) brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. The film's rendering of &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, adapted and orchestrated by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], was a Top 5 hit in 1974.

Ragtime ‚Äì with Joplin's work at the forefront ‚Äì has been cited as an American equivalent of the [[minuet]]s of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], the [[mazurka]]s of [[Fr√©d√©ric Chopin|Chopin]], or the [[waltz]]es of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, H. Wiley. &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, 1971, p.84, cited in ''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Ragtime also influenced [[Classical music|classical]] composers including [[Erik Satie]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rb6&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickinson|first=Peter|title=Reviews of Books|journal=Music and Letters|date=1 January 1987|volume=68|issue=1|pages=78‚Äì79|doi=10.1093/ml/68.1.78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Ragtime originated in African American music in the late 19th century and descended from the jigs and march music played by African American bands, referred to as &quot;jig piano&quot; or &quot;piano thumping&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vdm&quot;&gt;[[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] (1989). Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of nineteenth-Century Popular Music. Oxford: Clarendon Press. ISBN 0-19-316121-4, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From Piano Thumping to the Concert Stage: The Rise of Ragtime|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=April 1973|volume=59|issue=8|page=53|url=http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/stable/3394278|doi=10.2307/3394278}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the 20th century, it became widely popular throughout North America and was listened and danced to, performed, and written by people of many different subcultures. A distinctly American musical style, ragtime may be considered a synthesis of African syncopation and European classical music, especially the marches made popular by [[John Philip Sousa]].

Some early piano rags are entitled marches, and &quot;jig&quot; and &quot;rag&quot; were used interchangeably in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;vdm&quot;/&gt; Ragtime was also preceded by its close relative the [[cakewalk]]. In 1895, black entertainer [[Ernest Hogan]] composed two of the earliest [[sheet music]] rags, one of which (&quot;All Coons Look Alike to Me&quot;) eventually sold a million copies. The other composition was  called La Pas Ma La which was also a hit ,&lt;ref name=&quot;lw1&quot;&gt;White, Loring. ''Ragging It: Getting Ragtime into History (and Some History into Ragtime)'', iUniverse, 2005. xiv, 419 pp. ISBN 0-595-34042-3, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; As fellow black musician Tom Fletcher said, Hogan was the &quot;first to put on paper the kind of rhythm that was being played by non-reading musicians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lw2&quot;&gt;''Ragging It'', p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; While the song's success helped introduce the country to ragtime rhythms, its use of racial slurs created a number of derogatory imitation tunes, known as &quot;[[coon songs]]&quot; because of their use of [[racist]] and [[stereotype|stereotypical]] images of blacks. In Hogan's later years he admitted shame and a sense of &quot;race betrayal&quot; for the song while also expressing pride in helping bring ragtime to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dvorak to Duke Ellington: A Conductor Explores America's Music and Its African American Roots|first=Maurice|last=Peress|authorlink=Maurice Peress|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{listen|filename=Maple Leaf RagQ.ogg|title=Maple Leaf Rag|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The emergence of mature ragtime is usually dated to 1897, the year in which several important early rags were published. In 1899, [[Scott Joplin]]'s &quot;[[Maple Leaf Rag]]&quot; was published and became a great hit and demonstrated more depth and sophistication than earlier ragtime. Ragtime was one of the main influences on the early development of jazz (along with the [[blues]]). Some artists, such as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], were present and performed both ragtime and jazz styles during the period the two genres overlapped. He also incorporated the [[Spanish Tinge]] in his performances, which gave a [[Contradanza|habanera]] or tango rhythm to his music.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz largely surpassed ragtime in mainstream popularity in the early 1920s, although ragtime compositions continue to be written up to the present, and periodic revivals of popular interest in ragtime occurred in the 1950s and the 1970s.

The heyday of ragtime occurred before sound recording was widely available. Like classical music, and unlike jazz, classical ragtime had and has primarily a written tradition, being distributed in [[sheet music]] rather than through recordings or by imitation of live performances. Ragtime music was also distributed via [[piano rolls]] for player pianos. A [[folk ragtime]] tradition also existed before and during the period of classical ragtime (a designation largely created by Scott Joplin's publisher [[John Stillwell Stark]]), manifesting itself mostly through string bands, banjo and [[mandolin]] clubs (which experienced a burst of popularity during the early 20th century) and the like.

[[Image:The Top Liner Rag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Lamb]]'s 1916 &quot;The Top Liner Rag&quot;, a [[Classic Rag|classic rag]]]]
A form known as [[novelty piano]] (or novelty ragtime) emerged as the traditional rag was fading in popularity. Where traditional ragtime depended on amateur pianists and sheet music sales, the novelty rag took advantage of new advances in piano-roll technology and the phonograph record to permit a more complex, pyrotechnic, performance-oriented style of rag to be heard. Chief among the novelty rag composers is [[Zez Confrey]], whose &quot;[[Kitten on the Keys]]&quot; popularized the style in 1921.

Ragtime also served as the roots for [[stride piano]], a more improvisational piano style popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Elements of ragtime found their way into much of the American popular music of the early 20th century. It also played a central role in the development of the musical style later referred to as [[Piedmont blues]]; indeed, much of the music played by such artists of the genre as [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Blind Boy Fuller]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], and [[Etta Baker]] could be referred to as &quot;ragtime guitar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bastin, Bruce. &quot;Truckin' My Blues Away: East Coast Piedmont Styles&quot; in ''Nothing But the Blues: The Music and the Musicians''.

Although most ragtime was composed for piano, transcriptions for other instruments and ensembles are common, notably including [[Gunther Schuller]]'s arrangements of Joplin's rags. Ragtime guitar continued to be popular into the 1930s, usually in the form of songs accompanied by skilled guitar work. Numerous records emanated from several labels, performed by Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, Lemon Jefferson, and others. Occasionally ragtime was scored for ensembles (particularly dance bands and [[brass band]]s) similar to those of [[James Reese Europe]], or as songs like those written by [[Irving Berlin]]. Joplin had long-standing ambitions of synthesizing the worlds of ragtime and [[opera]], to which end the opera ''[[Treemonisha]]'' was written. However its first performance, poorly staged with Joplin accompanying on the piano, was &quot;disastrous&quot; and it was never to be fully performed again in Joplin's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott, William B., and Rutkoff, Peter M. ''New York Modern: The Arts and the City'' Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (2001), p37&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the score was lost for decades, then rediscovered in 1970, and a fully orchestrated and staged performance took place in 1972.&lt;ref name=Peterson1993&gt;{{cite book |title=A century of musicals in black and white |last=Peterson |first=Bernard L. |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=0-313-26657-3 |page=357 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VQggZdq1hawC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357 |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier opera by Joplin, ''A Guest of Honor'', has been lost.&lt;ref name=classicalnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/joplin.html|title=Classical Net|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
[[File:Easy Winners 2.jpg|thumb|300px|The first page of &quot;The Easy Winners&quot; by [[Scott Joplin]], showing ragtime rhythms and syncopated melodies.]]
The rag was a modification of the [[March (music)|march]] made popular by [[John Philip Sousa]], with additional [[polyrhythm]]s coming from African music.&lt;ref name=&quot;rb2&quot;/&gt; It was usually written in 2/4 or 4/4 [[Metre (music)|time]] with a predominant left-hand pattern of bass notes on strong beats (beats 1 and 3) and chords on weak beats (beat 2 and 4) accompanying a [[syncopated]] melody in the right hand. According to some sources the name &quot;ragtime&quot; may come from the &quot;ragged or syncopated rhythm&quot; of the right hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlin&quot;/&gt; A rag written in 3/4 time is a &quot;ragtime waltz.&quot;

Ragtime is not a &quot;time&quot; (meter) in the same sense that march time is 2/4 meter and waltz time is 3/4 meter; it is rather a musical genre that uses an effect that can be applied to any meter. The defining characteristic of ragtime music is a specific type of syncopation in which [[melodic]] accents occur between metrical beats. This results in a melody that seems to be avoiding some metrical beats of the accompaniment by emphasizing notes that either anticipate or follow the beat (&quot;a rhythmic base of metric affirmation, and a melody of metric denial&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rb7&quot;&gt;''Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist'', p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;). The ultimate (and intended) effect on the listener is actually to accentuate the beat, thereby inducing the listener to move to the music. Scott Joplin, the composer/pianist known as the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot;, called the effect &quot;weird and intoxicating.&quot; He also used the term &quot;swing&quot; in describing how to play ragtime music: &quot;Play slowly until you catch the swing...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;School of Ragtime&quot; (1908) in ''Scott Joplin Collected Piano Works'', Edited by Vera Brodsky Lawrence, The New York Public Library, 1971, ISBN 0-87104-242-8, page 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The name [[Swing (genre)|swing]] later came to be applied to an early genre of jazz that developed from ragtime. Converting a non-ragtime piece of music into ragtime by changing the time values of melody notes is known as &quot;ragging&quot; the piece. Original ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, four being the most common number. These themes were typically 16 bars, each theme divided into periods of four four-bar phrases and arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Typical patterns were AABBACCC‚Ä≤, AABBACCDD and AABBCCA, with the first two strains in the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] key and the following strains in the subdominant. Sometimes rags would include introductions of four bars or bridges, between themes, of anywhere between four and 24 bars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlin&quot;/&gt;

==Styles of ragtime==
[[File:Shoe Tickler Rag.jpg|thumb|300px|Shoe Tickler Rag, cover of the music sheet for a song from 1911 by Wilbur Campbell]]

Ragtime pieces came in a number of different styles during the years of its popularity and appeared under a number of different descriptive names. It is related to several earlier styles of music, has close ties with later styles of music, and was associated with a few musical &quot;[[fad]]s&quot; of the period such as the [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]]. Many of the terms associated with ragtime have inexact definitions, and are defined differently by different experts; the definitions are muddled further by the fact that publishers often labelled pieces for the fad of the moment rather than the true style of the composition. There is even disagreement about the term &quot;ragtime&quot; itself; experts such as David Jasen and [[Trebor Jay Tichenor|Trebor Tichenor]] choose to exclude ragtime songs from the definition but include novelty piano and stride piano (a modern perspective), while Edward A. Berlin includes ragtime songs and excludes the later styles (which is closer to how ragtime was viewed originally). The terms below should not be considered exact, but merely an attempt to pin down the general meaning of the concept.

*''[[Cakewalk]]'' ‚Äì a pre-ragtime dance form popular until about 1904. The music is intended to be representative of an African-American dance contest in which the prize is a cake. Many early rags are cakewalks.
*''[[Characteristic march]]'' ‚Äì a march incorporating idiomatic touches (such as syncopation) supposedly characteristic of the race of their subject, which is usually African-Americans. Many early rags are characteristic marches.
*''[[Two-step (dance move)|Two-step]]'' ‚Äì a pre-ragtime dance form popular until about 1911. A large number of rags are two-steps.
*''[[Slow drag (dance)|Slow drag]]'' ‚Äì another dance form associated with early ragtime. A modest number of rags are slow drags.
*''[[Coon song]]'' ‚Äì a pre-ragtime vocal form popular until about 1901. A song with crude, racist lyrics often sung by white performers in [[blackface]]. Gradually died out in favor of the ragtime song. Strongly associated with ragtime in its day, it is one of the things that gave ragtime a bad name.
*''[[Ragtime song]]'' ‚Äì the vocal form of ragtime, more generic in theme than the coon song. Though this was the form of music most commonly considered &quot;ragtime&quot; in its day, many people today prefer to put it in the &quot;popular music&quot; category. [[Irving Berlin]] was the most commercially successful composer of ragtime songs, and his &quot;[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]&quot; (1911) was the single most widely performed and recorded piece of this sort, even though it contains virtually no ragtime syncopation. [[Gene Greene]] was a famous singer in this style.
*''[[Folk ragtime]]'' ‚Äì a name often used to describe ragtime that originated from small towns or assembled from folk strains, or at least sounded as if they did. [[Folk rags]] often have unusual chromatic features typical of composers with non-standard training.
*''[[Classic rag]]'' ‚Äì a name used to describe the Missouri-style ragtime popularized by Scott Joplin, James Scott, and others.
*''[[Foxtrot (dance)|Fox-trot]]'' ‚Äì a dance fad that began in 1913. Fox-trots contain a dotted-note rhythm different from that of ragtime, but which nonetheless was incorporated into many late rags.
*''[[Novelty piano]]'' ‚Äì a piano composition emphasizing speed and complexity, which emerged after World War I. It is almost exclusively the domain of white composers.
*''[[Stride piano]]'' ‚Äì a style of piano that emerged after World War I, developed by and dominated by black East-coast pianists ([[James P. Johnson]], [[Fats Waller]] and [[Willie 'The Lion' Smith]]). Together with novelty piano, it may be considered a successor to ragtime, but is not considered by all to be &quot;genuine&quot; ragtime. Johnson composed the song that is arguably most associated with the Roaring Twenties, &quot;[[Charleston (song)|Charleston]].&quot; A recording of Johnson playing the song appears on the compact disc ''James P. Johnson: Harlem Stride Piano'' (Jazz Archives No. 111, EPM, Paris, 1997). Johnson's recorded version has a ragtime flavor.

By far the most famous [[List of ragtime composers|ragtime composer]]&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Specifically, the composer whose worldwide reputation rested exclusively on ragtime works. Certain famous composers such as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Claude Debussy]] dabbled in the genre of ragtime but largely made their reputations in other repertoires.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Scott Joplin]]. [[Joseph Lamb]] and [[James Scott (musician)|James Scott]] are, together, acknowledged as the three most sophisticated ragtime composers. Other leading ragtime composers include [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Eubie Blake]], [[Charles L. Johnson]], [[Tom Turpin]], [[May Aufderheide]], [[Mike Bernard (musician)|Mike Bernard]], [[George Botsford]], [[Zez Confrey]], [[Ben Harney]], [[Luckey Roberts]], [[James P.

==Influence on European composers==
{{Essay-like|section|date=November 2012}}
{{Main|List of ragtime composers}}
European [[Classical music|Classical]] composers were influenced by the form. The first contact with ragtime was probably at the Paris Exposition in 1900, one of the stages of the European tour of [[John Philip Sousa]]. The first notable classical composer to take a serious interest in ragtime was [[Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k|Anton Dvor√†k]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Antonin Dvorak ‚Äì Symphony No. 9 &quot;From the New World&quot; In Nature's Realm ‚Äì Carnival|url=http://www.musicallyspeaking.com/id63.html|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; French composer [[Claude Debussy]] emulated ragtime in three pieces for piano. The best-known remains the ''Golliwog's Cake Walk'' (from the 1908 Piano Suite ''[[Children's Corner]]''). He later returned to the style with two preludes for piano: ''Minstrels'', (1910) and ''General Lavine-excentric'' (from his 1913 [[Pr√©ludes (Debussy)|Preludes]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;rb6&quot;/&gt; which was inspired by a M√©drano circus clown.

[[Image:On the Pike 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Scott (musician)|James Scott]]'s 1904 &quot;On the Pike&quot;, which refers to the midway of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair of 1904]]]]
[[Erik Satie]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and the other members of [[Les Six|The Group of Six]] in [[Paris]] never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is sometimes evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, ''Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot),'' (1917) and ''La Mort de Monsieur Mouche'', an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J.P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American [[cakewalk]] was very popular in [[Paris]] and Satie two years later wrote two rags, ''La Diva de l'empire'' and ''Piccadilly''. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. ''La Diva de l'empire'', a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title ''Stand-Walk Marche''; it was later subtitled ''Intermezzo Americain'' when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. ''Piccadilly'', another march, was initially titled ''The Transatlantique''; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York‚ÄìEurope route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gildo De Stefano, &quot;Ragtime, jazz &amp; dintorni&quot;, Preface by [[Amiri Baraka]]. SUGARCO Editions, [[Milan]] 2007. ISBN 978-88-7198-532-9&lt;/ref&gt; There is a similar influence in Milhaud's ballets ''Le boeuf sur le toite'' and ''Creation du Monde'', which he wrote after a trip to [[Harlem]] during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious. Examples include ''Pacific 231'', ''Pr√©lude et Blues'' and especially the ''Concertino'' for piano and orchestra.

[[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote a solo piano work called ''[[Piano-Rag-Music]]'' in 1919 and also included a rag in his theater piece ''[[L'histoire du soldat]]'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=L'HISTOIRE DU SOLDAT (THE SOLDIER'S TALE) A BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://myhome.sunyocc.edu/~bridger/papers/lhistpaper.htm#_ftn2|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Ravel]] is said to have heard [[Jimmie Noone]] and his group perform in Chicago. Despite the imprecise anecdote, Ravel's involvement with [[jazz]] is unquestionable, as it influenced many of his important works, for example the fox-trot of ''L'enfant et les sortil√®ges'', the blues of the ''Sonata for violin and piano'', ''Concerto in G'' and the ''Concerto for the left hand'', both composed for piano in 1931.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2015}}

From the 1960s on, composers from [[Sweden]] are producing ragtime, chief among them are Peter Lundberg, Sune &quot;Sumpen&quot; Borg, Peter Andersson, Ragnar Hellspong, Oscar Janner, Oleg Mezjuev,  Joakim  Stensh√§ll, Kimo Viklund, and Kjell Waltman.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2015}}

==Ragtime revivals==
In the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire, and as early as 1936 [[sound recordings|78 rpm records]] of Joplin's compositions were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jasen, David A. Discography of 78 rpm Records of Joplin Works, ''Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works'', New York Public Library, (1981), pp. 319‚Äì320&lt;/ref&gt; Old numbers written for piano were rescored for jazz instruments by jazz musicians, which gave the old style a new sound. The most famous recording of this period is [[Pee Wee Hunt]]'s version of [[Euday L. Bowman]]'s &quot;[[Twelfth Street Rag]].&quot;

A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s. A wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. Much of the ragtime recorded in this period is presented in a light-hearted novelty style, looked to with nostalgia as the product of a supposedly more innocent time. A number of popular recordings featured &quot;prepared pianos,&quot; playing rags on pianos with tacks on the hammers and the instrument deliberately somewhat out of tune, supposedly to simulate the sound of a piano in an old [[honky tonk]].

Three events brought forward a different kind of ragtime revival in the 1970s. First, pianist [[Joshua Rifkin]] brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin's work, ''[[Scott Joplin: Piano Rags]]'', on [[Nonesuch Records]], which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the &quot;Best Classical Performance ‚Äì Instrumental Soloist(s) without Orchestra&quot; category&lt;ref name=&quot;Past Winner Database&quot;/&gt; in 1971. This recording reintroduced Joplin's music to the public in the manner the composer had intended, not as a nostalgic stereotype but as serious, respectable music. Second, the [[New York Public Library]] released a two-volume set of &quot;The Collected Works of Scott Joplin,&quot; which renewed interest in Joplin among musicians and prompted new stagings of Joplin's [[opera]] ''[[Treemonisha]]''.&lt;ref name=Peterson1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ping-Robbins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Scott Joplin: a guide to research |last=Ping-Robbins |first=Nancy R. |authorlink= |year=1998 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-8240-8399-7 |page=289 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0FeXfmHEXfIC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289 |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next came the release and Grammy Award for [[The New England Ragtime Ensemble]]'s recording of Joplin's Red Back Book. Finally, with the release of the motion picture ''[[The Sting]]'' in 1973, which had a [[Marvin Hamlisch]] soundtrack of Joplin tunes originally edited by [[Gunther Schuller]], ragtime was brought to a wide audience. Hamlisch's rendering of Joplin's 1902 rag &quot;The Entertainer&quot; won an [[Academy Award]],&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/factsheets/awardsdb/env-awards-db-search,0,7169155.htmlstory?target=article&amp;searchtype=all&amp;Query= |title= Entertainment Awards Database |accessdate=2009-03-14 | work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an [[American Top 40]] hit in 1974, reaching #3 on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismusicgroup.com/Cue%20Sheets/05-18-74.pdf |title=Charis Music Group, compilation of cue sheets from the American Top 40 radio Show | accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant ragtime composers of the mid- to late-20th century include [[Max Morath]], [[William Bolcom]], [[Trebor Tichenor]],  [[David Thomas Roberts]], and [[Reginald Robinson]].

In 1998, an adaption of [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s historical novel ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' was produced on Broadway. With music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, the show featured several rags as well as songs in other musical genres.

Many modern musicians have again begun to find ragtime and incorporate it into their musical repertoires.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Such acts include [[Jay Chou]], [[Curtains for You]], [[Baby Gramps]] and [[Bob Milne]].&lt;ref&gt;''88 notes pour piano solo'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Neva Ed., 2015.p.267. ISBN 978 2 3505 5192 0&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''genealogy of musical genres''' is the pattern of [[music genre|musical genres]] that have contributed to the development of new genres. 

[[genealogy|Genealogical]] charts or family trees of musical genres show how new genres have emerged from existing genres and how multiple genres have contributed to a new genre. Since [[music]] can be endlessly broken down into smaller and smaller categories, a genealogical chart will usually focus on one major genre and its different strains. For instance, [[jazz]] is considered to be a genre with many subgenres, including New Orleans jazz, ragtime, swing, bebop, free jazz, and Latin jazz. How these developed out of one another is shown in a genealogical chart, often with major figures or innovators of each subgenre.

A genealogy of genres may also incorporate several major genres, such as jazz, [[rock and roll]] and [[folk music]]. The image accompanying this article shows how numerous [[Cuban music]]al styles have developed out of many other genres including some from Europe, Africa, the US, Latin America and other Caribbean countries. While focusing on Cuban music, the image also shows the genealogy of many [[popular music]] genres since the 18th century.

The family tree of music can also be explored by starting at the article for your favourite genre, and clicking on the items in the stylistic origins, subgenres, derivative forms, and fusion genres sections of the genre infobox.

However, the band's androgynous looks can be attributed as much to kayou kyoku (traditional Japanese pop) as to the eccentric costumes of '70s David Bowie and '80s hair bands.

==History==

===1980‚Äì2000: Origins and success===
Visual kei emerged in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;fashionlines&quot;/&gt; pioneered by bands such as [[X Japan]], [[D'erlanger]], [[Buck-Tick]] and [[Color (band)|Color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Dejima| first = Kouji| title = Bounce Di(s)ctionary Number 13 ‚Äì Visual Kei| work = bounce.com| language = Japanese| url = http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/| accessdate = 2007-09-12| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301175244/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/| archivedate = 1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term visual kei is believed to come from one of X Japan's slogans, &quot;Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visual kei jidai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Inoue | first = Takako | title = Visual kei no jidai | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Seiky≈´sha]] | location = Tokyo | isbn = 978-4-7872-3216-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two record labels, both founded in 1986, that were instrumental for helping the visual kei scene spread, they are [[Extasy Records]] in Tokyo and [[Free-Will]] in Osaka.&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;/&gt;

Extasy was created by X Japan's drummer and leader [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] and signed bands, not limited to visual kei acts, that would go on to make marks on the Japanese music scene, including [[Zi:Kill]],&lt;ref name=&quot;JRR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Kei and EXTASY RECORDS|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/2007/08/webzine/visual-kei-and-extasy-records-23|work=JRock Revolution|date=25 August 2007|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo Yankees]] and Ladies Room. [[Luna Sea]] and [[Glay]], who went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JRR&quot;/&gt; Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader Dynamite Tommy, while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as [[By-Sexual]] and [[Kamaitachi (band)|Kamaitachi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;/&gt; Currently Free-Will is still going strong and has been a major contributor in spreading modern visual kei outside Japan, whereas Extasy followed its owner and became based out of the US, signing and producing American acts, and has since faded away.

In 1992, X Japan tried to launch an attempt to enter the American market, even signing with [[Atlantic Records]] for a US album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jrock Legend: X JAPAN|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/2007/08/webzine/the-jrock-legend-x-japan-25|work=JRock Revolution|date=26 August 2007|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this ultimately did not happen. In the late 1980s and until the mid 1990s, visual kei received increasing popularity throughout Japan, when album sales from visual kei bands started to reach record numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;fashionlines&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oricon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/confidence/23842/ |title=Shinjidai ni Totsunyu! Neo Visual Kei Band Taid≈ç no Kizashi |work=[[Oricon]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable bands to achieve success during this period included X Japan, Luna Sea and Buck-Tick; however, a drastic change in their appearance accompanied their success. During the same period other bands, such as [[Kuroyume]], [[Malice Mizer]] and [[Penicillin (band)|Penicillin]], gained mainstream awareness, although they were not as commercially successful. By the late 1990s, the mainstream popularity of visual kei was declining;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA&quot;/&gt; X Japan had disbanded in 1997 and one year later their lead guitarist [[hide (musician)|hide]] died, and in 2000, Luna Sea decided to disband as well. In 1998, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Steve McClure commented that &quot;To a certain extent, hide's death means the end of an era, X were the first generation of visual kei bands, but the novelty has worn off. For the next generation of bands, it's like: ''That's it. The torch has been passed to us.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt;

===2000‚Äìpresent===
[[File:Versailles Chile.jpg|thumb|right|[[Versailles (band)|Versailles]] performing in 2010, wearing costumes similar to the French [[Rococo]] style.]]
Notable newer visual kei bands include [[The Gazette (band)|The Gazette]], [[Alice Nine]], [[Dir en Grey]] and [[D'espairsRay]], who have all performed overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;/&gt; Veterans of the scene have also established new acts, such as Malice Mizer's [[Mana (musician)|Mana]] with his band [[Moi dix Mois]], and three members of [[Pierrot (band)|Pierrot]] forming [[Angelo (band)|Angelo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce&quot;/&gt; In 2007, visual kei was revitalized as Luna Sea performed a one-off performance and X Japan officially reunited with a new single and a world tour. With these developments, visual kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, with bands formed around 2004 having been described by some media as {{nihongo|&quot;Neo-Visual Kei&quot;|„Éç„Ç™„Éª„É¥„Ç£„Ç∏„É•„Ç¢„É´Á≥ª}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oricon&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
There has been criticism directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost the spirit of their forefathers, copying each other and becoming all the same. As far back as 1998, [[Neil Strauss]] reported that to visual kei bands &quot;after X&quot; makeup and outrageous looks became &quot;more important than music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; In 2008, [[Kirito]] vocalist of Pierrot and Angelo said &quot;Now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way because they want to be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is obviously very different from when we started out more than ten years ago.&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Angelo&quot;/&gt; and [[Sugizo]] of Luna Sea expressed concern in 2010 that &quot;They cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sugizo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SUGIZO on LUNA SEA|url=http://www.jame-world.com/uk/articles-68169-sugizo-on-luna-sea.html|work=JRock Revolution|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although from the newer generation himself, Dir en grey bassist [[Toshiya (musician)|Toshiya]] said in 2010 &quot;To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha.&quot; and added &quot;The music was so unique, too ‚Äì bands like X Japan. At that time, there weren't any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DirTimes&quot;/&gt; Kenzi of Kamaitachi, [[The Dead Pop Stars]] and [[Anti Feminism]] commented in 2009 that &quot;Back in the day, there were bands, but people would try to do things differently. Nowadays, there's one band, and everyone copies off of them.&quot;, with Free-Will founder and Color frontman Tommy concluding with &quot;I don't think our breed of visual kei exists anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KillingRedAddictio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: The Killing Red Addiction|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/2009/07/webzine/interview-the-killing-red-addiction-275|work=JRock Revolution|date=12 July 2009|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
Visual kei has enjoyed popularity among [[Indie (music)|independent]] underground projects, as well as artists achieving [[mainstream]] success, with influences from Western phenomena, such as [[glam rock|glam]], [[goth subculture|goth]] and [[cyberpunk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammy_kabuki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blistering_deg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Mascia| first = Mike| title = Dir en grey feature interview| work = [[Blistering]]| url = http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3| accessdate = 2007-08-07|quote=When we were growing up around [the] late '80s and early '90s, visual kei was influenced by glam music.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music performed encompasses a large variety of [[music genre|genres]], i.e. [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], pop and [[electronica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jmf_jrock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grammy_kabuki&quot;/&gt; Magazines published regularly in Japan with visual kei coverage are ''Arena 37&amp;nbsp;¬∞C'', ''[[Cure (magazine)|Cure]]'', ''Fool's Mate'' and ''[[Shoxx]]''. The popularity and awareness of visual kei groups outside Japan has seen an increase in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cure Vol 34&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Cure (magazine)|Cure]] |volume= 34 |issue= July 2006 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most of [[pop music]], its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[verse‚Äìchorus form|verse‚Äìchorus structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm|title=Pop Music - What Is Pop Music - A Definition and Brief History|publisher=Top40.about.com|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult contemporary is heavy on romantic [[sentimental ballad]]s which mostly use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments (though [[bass guitar]] is usually used) such as [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[piano]]s, [[saxophones]], and sometimes an [[orchestral]] set. The [[electric guitar]]s are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may usually feature [[synthesizer]]s (and other electronics, such as [[drum machines]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Curtis, ''Rock eras: interpretations of music and society, 1954-1984'' (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

AC [[radio station]]s may play mainstream music, but they will exclude [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dance music|dance tracks]], [[Hard Rock|hard rock]], and some forms of [[teen pop]], as they are less popular amongst the target [[demographic]] of these radio stations, which is intended for an [[adult]] [[audience]]. AC radio often targets the 25‚Äì44 age group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/108810/adult-contemporary-s-demographic-fault-line-is-now Adult Contemporary's Demographic Fault Line Is Now 45]. AllAccess.com (August 3, 2012). Retrieved on September 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years is that many adult contemporary stations play less newer music because they also give ample airtime to hits of the past, so the de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brecht|first=Robert M.|title=Advertising Shifting to Targeting Older Demographic Segments|url=http://www.dmn3.com/dmn3-blog/advertising-shifting-to-targeting-older-demographic-segments|work=DMN3 Blog|publisher=DMN3|accessdate=March 17, 2012|date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including &quot;hot AC&quot;, &quot;soft AC&quot; (also known as &quot;lite AC&quot;), &quot;[[urban adult contemporary|urban AC]]&quot;, &quot;[[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]&quot;, and &quot;Christian AC&quot; (a softer type of [[contemporary Christian music]]). Some stations play only &quot;hot AC&quot;, &quot;soft AC&quot;, or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific [[genre]] of [[music]]; it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from [[musician]]s of many different genres.

==History==

===1960s: Early roots; Easy listening and soft rock===
[[File:Johnny Mathis 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Johnny Mathis]] concentrated on romantic readings of jazz and pop standards for the adult contemporary audience of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-mathis-mn0000246885|title=Johnny Mathis - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=September 30, 1935|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s [[easy listening]] format, which adopted a 70-80% instrumental - 20-30% vocal mix. A few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. The easy listening format, as it was first known, was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as &quot;[[rock and roll]]&quot; stations. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' first published the Easy Listening chart July 17, 1961, with 20 songs; the first number one was &quot;[[Boll Weevil Song]]&quot; by [[Brook Benton]]. The chart described itself as &quot;not too far out in either direction&quot;.&lt;ref name=Trust&gt;Trust, Gary (July 23, 2011). &quot;Vanilla Is Licking the Competition&quot;. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Vol. 123, Issue 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Doris Day]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Perry Como]], and others. The custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent [[rock and roll]] or [[pop music|pop]] hit songs, a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without [[selling out]]. Some stations would also occasionally play earlier [[big band]]-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/notes/v061/61.4goldsmith.html|title=Project MUSE - Lounge Caravan: A Selective Discography|doi=10.1353/not.2005.0059|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|date=February 23, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1965, differences between the [[Hot 100]] chart and the Easy Listening chart became more pronounced. Better reflecting what middle of the road stations were actually playing, the composition of the chart changed dramatically. As rock music continued to harden, there was much less crossover between the Hot 100 and Easy Listening chart than there had been in the early half of the 1960s. [[Roger Miller]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Bobby Vinton]] were among the chart's most popular performers.&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt;

One big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was that, when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (or &quot;MOR&quot;) stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era [[adult standards]] and [[big band]] titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs.

Another big impetus for the evolution of the AC radio format was the popularity of easy listening or &quot;[[beautiful music]]&quot; stations, stations with music specifically designed to be purely [[background music|ambient]]. Whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists, and rarely purchased, AC was an attempt to create a similar &quot;lite&quot; format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists.

===1970s: Soft rock forms as a radio format===
{{See also|Soft rock|List of soft rock artists and songs}}
[[Hard rock]] had been established as a mainstream genre by 1965. From the end of the 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated687&quot;/&gt; with both emerging as major radio formats in the US.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Keith, ''The Radio Station: Broadcast, Satellite and Internet'' (Focal Press, 8th edn., 2009), ISBN 0-240-81186-0, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soft rock]] was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included  [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Carole King]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[James Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954-1984'' (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bread (band)|Bread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Soft Rock |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/soft-rock-ma0000011841 |title=Soft Rock : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/genresmovements/p/softrockprofile.htm |title=Soft Rock - Profile of the Mellow, Romantic Soft Rock of the '70s and Early '80s |publisher=80music.about.com |date=April 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s, when the texture of much of the music played on [[Top 40]] radio once more began to soften. The adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it, with rock-oriented acts as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]], and [[Elton John]] becoming associated with the format.&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt;

Soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid-to-late 1970s with acts such as [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley]], [[Air Supply]], [[Seals and Crofts]], [[America (band)|America]] and the reformed [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, some radio stations, like New York's [[WTFM]] and [[NBC]]-owned [[WYNY (defunct)|WYNY]], had switched to an all-soft rock format.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Sterling, M. C. Keith, ''Sounds of Change: a History of FM broadcasting in America'' (UNC Press, 2008), pp. 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as [[Journey (band)|Journey]].&lt;ref name=SoftRockClassificationBBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11733277|title=Journey: The band who did not stop believing|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 6, 2010|date=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SoftRockClassificationMM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mademan.com/mm/10-best-soft-rock-ballads.html|title=10 Best Soft Rock Ballads|publisher=Made Man|accessdate=December 6, 2010}} ‚ÄúJourney fans can easily list a dozen soft rock ballads from the band...‚Äù&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Sabo and his team at NBC brought in major personalities from the AM Band to the FM Band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience. The addition of major radio stars such as Dan Daniel, Steve O'Brien, Dick Summers, Don Bleu and Tom Parker made it possible to fully monetize the format and provide the foundation for financial success enjoyed to this day

Radio stations played [[Top 40]] hits regardless of genre; although, most were in the same genre until the mid-1970s when different forms of popular music started to target different demographic groups, such as [[disco]] vs. [[hard rock]]. This evolved into specialized radio stations that played specific genres of music, and generally followed the evolution of artists in those genres.

By the early 1970s, softer songs by artists like [[The Carpenters]], [[Anne Murray]], [[John Denver]], [[Barry Manilow]], and even Streisand, began to be played more often on &quot;Top 40&quot; radio and others were added to the mix on many AC stations. Also, some of these stations even played softer songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Billy Joel]], and other rock-based artists.

Much of the music recorded by [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Diana Ross]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Carole King]] and [[Janis Ian]] got as much, if not more, airplay on this format than on Top 40 stations. Easy Listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres, such as rock and roll or [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]]. In addition, several early disco songs, did well on the Adult Contemporary format.

===1980s: Adult contemporary succeeds as radio format===
[[File:George Michael.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|&quot;[[Careless Whisper]]&quot; stayed at the #1 spot in the adult contemporary chart for 18 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=wham!|chart=all}}|title=Careless Whisper - Wham!|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was [[George Michael]]'s first solo single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-michael-mn0000545074|title=George Michael - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 25, 1963|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On April 7, 1979, the Easy Listening chart officially became known as Adult Contemporary,&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt; and those two words have remained consistent in the name of the chart ever since. Adult contemporary music became one of the most popular [[radio format]]s of the 1980s. The growth of AC was a natural result of the [[generation]] that first listened to the more &quot;specialized&quot; music of the mid-late 1970s growing older and not being interested in the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hip hop music|rap/hip-hop]] music that a new generation helped to play a significant role in the [[Top 40 chart]]s by the end of the decade.

Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists like [[Barbra Streisand]], the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[John Denver]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]] found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] format, such as [[Richard Marx]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[George Michael]], [[Phil Collins]], and [[Laura Branigan]] began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by [[AllMusic]] as &quot;one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-collins-mn0000337119/biography| title= Phil Collins Biography | work=AllMusic | first=William | last=Ruhlmann | accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time.

The amount of crossover between the AC chart and the Hot 100 has varied based on how much the passing pop music trends of the times appealed to adult listeners. Not many [[disco]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] songs were particularly successful on the AC chart during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and much of the hip-hop and harder rock music featured on [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] formats later in the decade would have been unacceptable on AC radio.

Although dance-oriented, electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to artists like [[Sheena Easton]], [[Amy Grant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amy-grant-mn0000024944|title=Amy Grant - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lionel Richie]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Dan Hill]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Billy Ocean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-ocean-mn0000089058|title=Billy Ocean - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=January 21, 1950|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Bertie Higgins]] and [[Tommy Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fawthrop|first=Peter|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-page-mn0000624184|title=Tommy Page - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=May 24, 1970|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No song spent more than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat. Two of these were by Lionel Richie, &quot;[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]&quot; in 1983 and &quot;[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]&quot; in 1984, which also reached #1 on the Hot 100.

In 1989, [[Linda Ronstadt]] released ''[[Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind]]'', described by critics as &quot;the first true Adult Contemporary album of the decade&quot;, featuring American soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the twelve tracks. The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe. The [[Grammy Award]]-winning singles, &quot;[[Don't Know Much]]&quot; and &quot;[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]&quot;, were both long-running #1 Adult Contemporary hits. Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well. The album won over many critics in the need to define AC, and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play.

===1990s: Subgenre formations/radio crossovers===
[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latin artist [[Marc Anthony]]'s self-titled English-language album released in 1999 had singles that crossed over to the AC charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marc-anthony-mn0000673486|title=Marc Anthony - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The early 1990s marked the softening of urban R&amp;B at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence. This in part led to a widening of the market, not only allowing to cater to more niche markets, but it also became customary for artists to make AC-friendly singles.

Unlike the majority of 1980s mainstream singers, the 1990s mainstream pop/R&amp;B singers such as [[All-4-One]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=all-4-one|chart=all}}|title=All-4-One Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boyz II Men]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], [[Christina Aguilera]],&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=all}}|title=Mariah Carey Music News &amp; Info|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Savage Garden]]&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard.com&quot;/&gt; generally crossed over to the AC charts. [[Latin pop]] artists such as [[Lynda Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloid=20981|title=Lynda realiza su internacionalizaci√≥n |date=|accessdate=2015-03-27 |publisher=terra.com.mx|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ricky Martin]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Selena]], [[Enrique Iglesias]] and [[Luis Miguel]] also enjoyed success in the AC charts.

In addition to [[Celine Dion]], who has had significant success on this chart, other artists with multiple number ones on the AC chart in the 1990s include [[Mariah Carey]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Shania Twain]]. Newer female singer-songwriters such as [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Melissa Etheridge]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] also broke through on the AC chart during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyatt&quot;&gt;Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits''.  New York City:  [[Billboard Books]].  ISBN 978-0-823-07693-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, ''Billboard'' created a new chart called [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Top 40]], which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between &quot;adult contemporary&quot; music and &quot;pop&quot; music. Although they are sometimes mistaken for each other, the Adult Contemporary chart and the Adult Top 40 chart are separate charts, and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other. In addition, [[Hot adult contemporary|hot AC]] is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart as it exists today, despite the apparent similarity in name.

In response to the pressure on Hot AC, a new kind of AC format cropped up among American radio recently. The ''[[urban adult contemporary]]'' format (a term coined by [[Barry Mayo]]) usually attracts a large number of [[African Americans]] and sometimes [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] listeners through playing a great deal of [[R&amp;B]] (without any form of rapping), [[gospel music]], classic soul and [[dance music]] (including [[disco]]).

Another format, ''[[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]'', in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft AC music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on [[disco]] as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits, such as those by [[Amber (performer)|Amber]], [[C&amp;C Music Factory]] and [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], and includes dance [[remixes]] of pop songs, such as the [[Soul Solution]] mix of [[Toni Braxton]]'s &quot;Unbreak My Heart&quot;.

In its early years of existence, the [[smooth jazz]] format was considered to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and related a stronger resemblance to the soft AC-styled music. For many years, artists like [[George Benson]], [[Kenny G]] and [[Dave Koz]] had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft AC stations.

===2000‚Äìpresent: mainstream music goes AC===
[[File:MichaelBubleDanceFeb2011.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A number of [[Michael Bubl√©]]'s singles and albums topped the AC charts in the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Latham|first=Aaron|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-bubl%C3%A9-mn0000885569|title=Michael Bubl√© - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=September 9, 1975|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on AC charts, even after the songs have fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for [[RCA Music Group]], said, &quot;We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play&quot;. Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and [[adult top 40]], but only after the hits had become established.&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt; An article on [[MTV]]'s website by Corey Moss describes this trend: &quot;In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death. Or, to optimists, to get a second life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV&quot;&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1544498/20061031/gnarls_barkley.jhtml &quot;Never A 'Bad Day' ‚Äî Adult-Contemporary Radio, Where Pop Hits Live Strong&quot;, from mtv.com] Retrieved February 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the mixture of radio friendly AC tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts, mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define AC, and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play. Part of the reason why more and more hot AC stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill; most new rock is too [[alternative music|alternative]] for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2007). ''Billboard Top Adult Songs 1961-2006'' (Record Research Inc.), page 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular trend in this era was remixing [[dance music]] hits into adult contemporary ballads, especially in the US, (for example, the &quot;Candlelight Mix&quot; versions of &quot;[[Heaven (Bryan Adams song)|Heaven]]&quot; by [[DJ Sammy]], &quot;Listen To Your Heart&quot; by [[DHT (band)|D.H.T.]], and &quot;[[Everytime We Touch (Cascada song)|Everytime We Touch]]&quot; by [[Cascada]]). Adult contemporary has long characterized itself as family-friendly, but edited versions of &quot;[[Perfect (Pink song)|Perfect]]&quot; by [[Pink (singer)|P!nk]] and &quot;[[Forget You (Cee Lo Green song)|Forget You]]&quot; by [[Cee Lo Green]] showed up in the format in 2011.&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt;

While most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary, [[Michael Bubl√©]] and [[Josh Groban]] started out as AC artists.&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt; Throughout this decade, artists such as [[Nick Lachey]], [[James Blunt]], [[John Mayer]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Adele]], [[Clay Aiken]] and [[Susan Boyle]] have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound. Much as some hot AC and modern rock artists have crossed over into each other, so too has soft AC crossed with [[country music]] in this decade. Country musicians such as [[Faith Hill]], [[Shania Twain]], [[LeAnn Rimes]] and [[Carrie Underwood]] have had success on both charts.

Since the mid-2000s, the mainstreaming of bands like [[Wilco]] and [[Feist (singer)|Feist]] have pushed [[indie rock]] into the adult contemporary conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Frannie|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/10/26/141694029/has-indie-become-adult-contemporary|title=Has 'Indie' Become 'Adult Contemporary'? : The Record|publisher=NPR|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2010s, indie musicians like [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Mumford &amp; Sons]], [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[The Lumineers]] and [[Ed Sheeran]] also had indie songs that crossed over to the adult contemporary charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/10/26/141694029/has-indie-become-adult-contemporary Has 'Indie' Become 'Adult Contemporary'? : The Record]. NPR. Retrieved on September 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of the &quot;hot AC&quot; format contrasted with the near-demise of most other AC formats: Beginning with the 2005-2007 economic downturn and eventual recession most stations went for the more chart-based CHR, along with the top 40, urban and even Latino formats. Diminishing physical record sales also proved a major blow to the AC genre.

The &quot;soft&quot; AC format has reinvented in the late 2000s/early 2010s as a result of its declining relevance, adopting a more upmarket, middle-of-the-road approach, with a selection of &quot;oldies&quot; (usually from the 1960s/70s onwards), primarily rock, jazz, R&amp;B and pop music. Newer songs are more often (but not limited to) &quot;easy listening&quot; fare, this amount varying depending on the age of the station's target demographic.

==Adult contemporary formats==
===Soft adult contemporary===
{{See also|Soft rock|List of soft rock artists and songs}}
Termed &quot;the acoustic equivalent to [[Prozac]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Libby|first=Haddon|title=From 33 1/3 to 45|year=2012|url=http://www.33to45.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''soft adult contemporary'', a more adult-oriented version of AC, was born in the late 1970s and grew in the early 1980s. [[WODS|WEEI-FM]] in Boston was the first station to use the term &quot;[[soft rock]]&quot;, with ad slogans such as, &quot;[[Fleetwood Mac]] ... without the yack&quot; and &quot;[[Joni Mitchell|Joni]] ... without the baloney&quot;. The vast majority of music played on soft AC stations is mellow, more acoustic, and primarily solo vocalists.

Other popular names for the format include &quot;Warm&quot;, &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;Bee&quot; (or &quot;B&quot;) and (particularly in Canada) &quot;[[EZ Rock]]&quot;. The format can be seen as a more contemporary successor to and combination of the [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (MOR), [[beautiful music]], [[easy listening]] and [[soft rock]] formats. Many stations in the soft AC format capitalize on its appeal to office workers (many of them females aged 25‚Äì54, a key advertiser demographic), and brand themselves as stations &quot;everyone at work can agree on&quot; (KOST originated that phrase as a primary tagline, and other soft AC stations have followed suit).

A large portion of music played on this format are either considered oldies or recurrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/what-is-adult-contemporary-music.htm|title=What is Adult Contemporary Music?|publisher=Top40.about.com|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often deals with modern [[romance (love)|romantic]] and [[sexual relationships]] (and sometimes other adult themes such as work, raising children, and family) in a thoughtful and complex way.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldies.about.com&quot;/&gt; Soft AC, which has never minded keeping songs in high rotation literally for years in some cases, does not appear necessarily to be facing similar pressures to expand its format. Soft AC includes a larger amount of older music, especially classic R&amp;B, [[soul music|soul]], and 1960s and 1970s music, than hot AC.

The soft AC format may soon be facing the demographic pressures that the [[jazz]] and [[big band]] formats faced in the 1960s and 1970s and that the oldies format is starting to face today, with the result that one may hear soft AC less on over-the-air radio and more on [[satellite radio]] systems in coming years. Much of the music and artists that were traditionally played on soft AC stations have been relegated to the adult standards format, which is itself disappearing because of aging demographics. Some soft AC stations have found a niche by incorporating more oldies into their playlists and are more open to playing softer songs that fit the &quot;traditional&quot; definition of AC.

Artists contributing to this format include mainly soft rock/pop singers such as [[Andy Williams]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], and [[Marc Anthony]].

===Hot adult contemporary===
{{See also|Adult Top 40|Adult album alternative}}

''Hot adult contemporary'' radio stations play a variety of [[classic hits]] and [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|contemporary mainstream music]] aimed at an adult audience. Some Hot AC stations concentrate slightly more on [[pop music]] and [[alternative rock]] to target the [[Generation Z]] audience, though they include the more youth-oriented [[teen pop]], urban and rhythmic dance tracks.

This format often includes dance-pop (such as upbeat songs by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Cher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cher|chart=all}}|title=Believe - Cher|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Kylie Minogue]]&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;), [[power pop]]s (mainly by [[boybands]] such as [[Backstreet Boys]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=backstreet boys|chart=all}}|title=Backstreet Boys Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Westlife]]), and adult-oriented soft rock music that are ballad-driven (typically by [[Aerosmith]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, [[The Eagles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eagles|chart=all}}|title=Eagles Music News &amp; Info|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sting (singer)|Sting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=sting|chart=all}}|title=Sting Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|date=|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toto (band)|Toto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=toto|chart=all}}|title=Toto Music News &amp; Info|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Moody Blues]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/the-moody-blues/chart-history/5238#/artist/the-moody-blues/chart-history/5238|title=The Moody Blues Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Generally, Hot AC radio stations target their music output towards the 18-54 age group and a demographic audience of both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Schiffman and Dana Hall, &quot;Modern debates value of '80s gold.&quot; ''Billboard'', June 14, 1997, Vol. 109 Issue 24, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; ''

==== Modern adult contemporary ====
''Modern adult contemporary'' can be a variation of hot AC, and includes [[modern rock]] titles in its presentation. In 1997, Mike Marino of [[KMXB]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] described the format as reaching &quot;an audience that has outgrown the edgier hip-hop or alternative music but hasn't gotten old and sappy enough for the soft ACs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&amp;R-1996-12-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The format's artists included [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Gin Blossoms]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[No Doubt]], [[The Script]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the script|chart=all}}|title=The Script Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cranberries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the cranberries|chart=all}}|title=The Cranberries Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=lifehouse|chart=all}}|title=Lifehouse Album &amp; Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|date=|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[John Mayer]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], and [[Ingrid Michaelson]]. Unlike modern rock, which went after 18-34 men, this format appealed to women.

===Urban and rhythmic adult contemporary===
''[[Urban adult contemporary|Urban AC]]'' is a form of AC music geared towards adult [[African-American]] audiences, and therefore, the artists that are played on these stations are most often black, such as [[Des'ree]], whose album ''[[I Ain't Movin']]'' was massively popular amongst both African American audience as well as the wider national audience.

The urban AC stations resemble soft AC rather than hot AC; they play predominantly [[R&amp;B]] and [[soul music]] with little [[hip-hop]]. This is reflected in many of the urban AC radio stations' [[tagline]]s, such as &quot;Today's R&amp;B and classic soul&quot;, &quot;The best variety of R&amp;B hits and oldies&quot; and &quot;(City/Region)'s R&amp;B leader&quot;. Urban AC's core artists include [[Luther Vandross]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[Craig David]] and [[Mariah Carey]].

A more elaborate form of urban AC is the '''[[rhythmic oldies]]''' format, which focuses primarily on &quot;old school&quot; R&amp;B and soul hits from the 1960s to the 1990s, including [[Motown]] and [[disco]] hits. The format includes soul or disco artists such as [[ABBA]], [[Village People|The Village People]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]], [[Gloria Gaynor]] and the [[Bee Gees]]. Rhythmic oldies stations still exist today, but target [[African-Americans]] as opposed to a mass audience.

A format called [[quiet storm]] is often included in urban adult contemporary, and is often played during the evening, blending the urban AC and soft AC styles of music. The music that is played is strictly ballads and slow jams, mostly but not limited to Black and Latino artists. Popular artists in the quiet storm format are [[Teena Marie]], [[Freddie Jackson]], [[Johnny Gill]], [[Lalah Hathaway]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]], [[Toni Braxton]], and [[En Vogue]] among others.

[[Anita Baker]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Regina Belle]], and [[Luther Vandross]] are other examples of artists who appeal to mainstream AC, urban AC and smooth jazz listeners. Some soft AC and urban AC stations like to play smooth jazz on the weekends. In recent years, the Smooth Jazz format has been renamed to Smooth AC, as an attempt to lure younger listeners.

====Adult contemporary R&amp;B====
''Adult contemporary R&amp;B'' may be played on both ''soft AC'' stations and ''urban AC''. It is a form of [[neo soul]] R&amp;B that places emphasis on songcraft and sophistication. As the use of drum machines, synthesizers, and [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] dominates R&amp;B-rooted music, adult contemporary R&amp;B tends to take most of its cues from the more refined strains of 1970s soul, such as [[smooth soul]], [[Philly soul]] and quiet storm. Classic songwriting touches and organic-leaning instrumentation, often featuring [[string arrangement]]s and [[French horn|horn]] charts, were constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adult Contemporary R&amp;B|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/adult-contemporary-r-b-ma0000012131|title=Adult Contemporary R&amp;B : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, lush jazz-R&amp;B fusion ([[George Benson]], [[Patti Austin]], [[Al Jarreau]]) and stylish crossover R&amp;B ([[Anita Baker]] and Luther Vandross, [[New Edition]] and [[Keith Sweat]]) were equally successful within the mainstream. In the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), artists as sonically contrasting as [[R. Kelly]], [[Leona Lewis]] (mainly ballads) and [[Jill Scott]] both fit the bill, provided the audience for the material was mature. By riding and contributing to nearly all of the trends, no one has exemplified the style more than [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], whose career thrived over 20 years as a member of the Deele (''[[Two Occasions]]''), a solo artist (''[[Whip Appeal]]'', ''[[When Can I See You]]''), and a songwriter/producer (Toni Braxton's ''[[Breathe Again]]'', Boyz II Men's ''[[I'll Make Love to You]]'').

===Contemporary Christian music===
''[[Contemporary Christian music]]'' (CCM) has several subgenres, one being &quot;Christian AC&quot;. ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'', for instance, lists Christian AC among its format charts. There has been crossover to mainstream and hot AC formats by many of the core artists of the Christian AC genre, notably [[Amy Grant]], [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Kathy Troccoli]], [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], [[Plumb (band)|Plumb]], and more recently, [[MercyMe]].

==Christmas music==
{{see also|Christmas music#Radio broadcasting}}

Since the 1990s it has become common for many AC stations, particularly soft AC stations, to play primarily or exclusively [[Christmas music]] during the Christmas season in November and December. While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format, most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop, [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]], and [[adult standards]] artists ‚Äì such as [[Nat King Cole]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Dean Martin]], [[The Carpenters]], [[Percy Faith]], [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Andy Williams]] ‚Äì many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year.

These Christmas music marathons typically start during the week before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] and end after [[Christmas Day]], or sometimes extending to [[New Year's Day]]. Afterwards, the stations usually resume their normal music fare. Several stations begin the holiday format much earlier, at the beginning of November. The roots of this tradition can be traced back to the [[beautiful music]] and [[easy listening]] stations of the 1960s and 1970s.

'''Psychedelic trance''', '''psytrance''' or just '''psy''' is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] characterized by arrangements of synthetic [[rhythm]]s and layered [[melodies]] created by high tempo [[riff]]s.&lt;ref name=PsyBook2010&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=o_ctCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=in+psytrance+similar+observations+full-on#v=onepage&amp;q=full-on&amp;f=false|author=Graham St John|title=The Local Scenes and Global Culture of Psytrance|isbn=1136944346|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.dur.ac.uk/anthropology.journal/vol16/iss2/ www.dur.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998 psytrance had become a mainstream form of music.

Some examples include full on, [[dark psytrance|darkpsy]], Hi-Tech, [[#Progressive_psychedelic_trance|progressive]], [[Suomisaundi|suomi]], psy-chill, psycore, psybient, psybreaks, or &quot;adapted&quot; tracks from other music genres. [[Goa trance]] preceded psytrance, when digital media became more commonly used psytrance evolved. Goa continues to develop alongside the other genres.&lt;ref name=PsyBook2010/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Voov experience 2005-02.jpg|thumb|VooV Experience 2005 ‚Äì one of the longest-existing psytrance openair events]]

===Origins===
{{See also|Goa trance}}
The first [[hippie]]s who arrived in [[Goa]], [[India]] in the mid-1960s were drawn there for many reasons, including the beaches, the low cost of living, the friendly locals, the Indian religious and spiritual practices and the readily available Indian cannabis, which until the mid-1970s was legal.
During the 1970s the first Goa DJs were generally playing [[psychedelic rock]] bands such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Doors]]. In 1979 the beginnings of [[electronic dance music]] could occasionally be heard in Goa in the form of tracks by artists such as [[Kraftwerk]] but it was not until 1983 that DJs Laurent and Fred Disko, closely followed by [[Goa Gil]], began switching the Goa style over to [[electro-industrial]]/[[Electronic Body Music|EBM]] which was now flooding out of Europe from [[Frontline Assembly]], [[Front 242]], [[Nitzer Ebb]] as well as [[Eurobeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FreeNRG : notes from the edge of the dance floor|year=2001|publisher=Common Ground Pub.|location=Altona, Victoria, Australia|isbn=1-86335-084-5|url=http://undergrowth.org/system/files/%5Beb06%5D_FreeNRG.pdf|author=Eugene ENRG (aka DJ Krusty)|editor=Graham St John|accessdate=28 March 2011|page=166|chapter=Psychic Sonics: Tribadelic Dance Trance-formation ‚Äì Eugene ENRG (aka DJ Krusty) interviews Ray Castle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The tracks were remixed, removing the lyrics, looping the melodies and beats and generally manipulating the sounds in all manner of ways before the tracks were finally presented to the dancers as custom Goa-style mixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FreeNRG : notes from the edge of the dance floor|year=2001|publisher=Common Ground Pub.|location=Altona, Victoria, Australia|isbn=1-86335-084-5|url=http://undergrowth.org/system/files/%5Beb06%5D_FreeNRG.pdf|author=Eugene ENRG (aka DJ Krusty)|editor=Graham St John|accessdate=28 March 2011|pages=167‚Äì168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Goa01.jpg|thumb|left|An indoor event]]
The music played in the 1980s was a blend of styles loosely defined as [[techno]] and various genres of computer music e.g. [[acid house]], [[electro (music)|electro]]. The music was brought on tape cassettes by fanatic traveler collectors and DJs. This material was shared and copied tape-to-tape by Goa DJs, in an underground scene that was not driven by music industry labels. The artists producing this &quot;special Goa music&quot; had no idea that their music was being played on the beaches of Goa by cyber hippies.

The first techno played in Goa was by [[Kraftwerk]] in the late 1970s on the tape of a visiting DJ. At that time, music played at most parties was performed by live bands, with tapes used to fill the space between sets. Old school acid heads who devoutly believed that only acid rock should be played at parties initially resisted, but they soon relented and converted to the revolutionary wave of technodelia that took hold in the 1980s. In the early 1980s, sampling synth and midi music appeared globally, and DJs became the preferred format in Goa. Two tape decks would drive a party with continuous music and continuous dancing. Cassette tapes were used by DJs until the 1990s, then [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT tapes]] were used.

Among DJs playing in Goa during the 1980s were Fred Disko, Dr Bobby, Stephano, Paulino, Mackie, Babu, Laurent, Ray, Fred, Antaro, Lui, Rolf, Tilo, Pauli, Rudi, and Gil. Their music was eclectic in style but nuanced around instrument/dub spacey versions of tracks that evoked mystical, cosmic, psychedelic, political, and existential themes. DJs in Goa made special mixes by editing various versions of a track to make it longer, taking the stretch mix concept to new levels. Trip music for journeying to outdoors, trance dancing to mind-expanding music while high on hallucinogens was the Goa mantra. The night clubs were not fueled by alcohol, but by hash and acid. The result was an anarchistic, alternative counterculture of DIY psychedelic exploration driven by future rhythm machine music.

By 1990‚Äì91 Goa was no longer under the radar and had become a hot destination for partying. As the scene grew bigger, Goa-style parties spread like a diaspora all over the world from 1993. Parties like Pangaea and [[megatripolis]] in the UK helped spawn a multitude of labels in various countries (U.K. Australia, Japan, Germany) to promote psychedelic electronic music that reflected the ethos of Goa parties, Goa music, and Goa-specific artists, producers, and DJs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa Trance as commercial scene began gaining global traction in 1994. The golden age of the first wave of Goa Psy Trance as a generally agreed upon genre was between 1994‚Äì97.

===Development===
[[File:Stepanida Borisova at Khan-Altay psytrance festival.JPG|thumb|Performance at a Russian psytrance festival, 2008]]
By 1992 the Goa trance scene had a pulse of its own, though the term 'Goa trance' didn‚Äôt become the name tag of the genre until around 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oranjebus.com/home-en/item/psychedelic-trance  www.oranjebus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Goa trance sound, which by the late 1990s was being used interchangeably with the term psychedelic trance, retained its popularity at outdoor [[rave]]s and festivals rather than in nightclubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  New artists were appearing from all over the world and it was in this year that the first Goa trance festivals began, including the Gaia Festival in France and the still-running VuuV festival in Germany.

In 1993 the first 100% Goa trance album was released, ''Project 2 Trance'', featuring tracks by [[Martin Freeland|Man With No Name]] and [[Hallucinogen (musician)|Hallucinogen]] to name two. Goa trance enjoyed its commercial peak between 1996 and 1997 with media attention and some recognised names in the DJ scene joining the movement. This hype did not last long and once the attention had died down so did the music sales, resulting in the failure of record labels, promotion networks and also some artists. This ‚Äòcommercial death of Goa trance‚Äô was marked musically by Matsuri Productions in 1997 with the release of the compilation ''Let it RIP''. On the back sleeve of the album at the bottom of the notes, R.I.P : Mother Theresa, Princess Diana, William Burroughs &amp; Goa Trance was written.

While the genre may have been incubated in the goa trance scene it went on to proliferate globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;acmp&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Altering Consciousness: Multidisciplinary Perspectives, Volume 1 |last=Carde√±a |first=Etzel |author2=Michael Winkelman  |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0313383081 |pages=212‚Äì213 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=1T7enU4PEwsC |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its impact was felt in western Europe, Israel, North America, Australia, Japan and South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;acmp&quot;/&gt; Psytrance is linked to other music genres such as [[big beat]], [[electroclash]], [[grime (music)|grime]] and [[2-step garage|2-step]].&lt;ref name=&quot;asts&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House |last=Collin |first=Matthew |year=2010 |publisher=Profile Books |isbn=1847656412 |page=335 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=fc8x9qeCekQC |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre evolved in conjunction with a multimedia psychedelic arts scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;acmp&quot;/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychedelic trance is distinguished from other subgenres because of the unique sounds it typically features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1pvlyk/genre_mondays_week_17_psytrance/ http://www.reddit.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; Psychedelic trance has a distinctive, energetic sound (generally between 136 and 140 BPM) that tends to be faster than other forms of trance or techno music. It uses a very distinctive resonated bass beat that pounds constantly throughout the song and overlays the bass with varying rhythms drawn from [[funk music|funk]], [[techno]], [[dance music|dance]], [[acid house]], [[eurodance]] and [[trance music|trance]] using drums and other instruments. The different leads, rhythms and beats generally change every 8 [[Bar (music)|bars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodbook.com/music/trance.html Trance music. A definition of genre.]. Retrieved 25 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Layering is used to great effect in psychedelic trance, with new musical ideas being added at regular intervals, often every 4 to 8 bars. New layers will continue to be added until a climax is reached, and then the song will break down and start a new rhythmic pattern over the constant bass line. Psychedelic trance tracks tend to be 6‚Äì10 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;Easwaran, Kenny. [http://web.archive.org/web/20110608042952/http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/psytrance.html &quot;Psytrance and the Spirituality of Electronics&quot;]. April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychedelic trance makes heavy use of the [[cutoff frequency]] control of the modulating filter on the synthesizer.  Reverb and delay are used heavily, with large, open sounding reverb present on most of the lead synthesizers in the track. The [[TB-303|Roland TB-303]] (acid) synthesizer, [[Roland Juno-106|Juno 106]], and [[Roland SH-101]] are heavily used and sampled in psychedelic trance, usually processed through a distortion effect.

===Full-On===
Fullon is a  psytrance style. Full-on is particularly popular in Israel.&lt;ref name=PsyBook2010 /&gt;

Full-on psychedelic trance is a High-energy music for peak moments. Often having melodic, energetic and crisp basslines under a low bpm rate (less than 140).  There are some related styles that are  derived from this style and are distinguished as different varieties of full-on: twilight and night full on (or dark full on) playing bolder and lower notes in their basslines, morning (light), and uplifting [http://www.ektoplazm.com/style/full-on].

===Progressive===
Progressive psytrance, is among the common party themes, normally distinguished between a psytrance (often fullon), and progressive dance floor.&lt;ref name=PsyBook2010 /&gt; Example progressive artists include [[Astrix]] or [[Protonica]].

===Suomisaundi===
{{Main|Suomisaundi}}
Suomisaundi is the &quot;freeform&quot; variation of psytrance, where the artist has almost no limits but still bear a specific &quot;Finnish&quot; style (which is also produced in other countries but the originating Suomi designation is in wide use).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Darkpsy ===
Dark psychedelic trance is the heavier end of the psychedelic trance spectrum with BPMs from about 148 and up. Related styles include psycore (fast and crazy), hi-tech (bouncy and glitchy), and forest (more organic and earthy). Characterized of having obscure, deep and more escathological background that leads into profund meditation of death, night and transcendence. Often with dismal sounds and heavy basslines.

'''Christian R&amp;B''' (also known as '''Gospel R&amp;B''', '''Rhythm &amp; Praise music''', and '''R&amp;P''') is a subgenre of [[rhythm and blues music]] consisting of Christian-based lyrics or of musicians typically known for writing such songs, with the purpose to uplift, entertain, or to simply give a Christian perspective of any topic. Some people may view Christian R&amp;B as a subgenre of [[gospel music]], or a cross-genre under both gospel and R&amp;B.

== Origin and Musical Style ==
It should be noted that [[gospel music]] is one of the roots or influences of R&amp;B music.&lt;ref&gt;Handyside, Christopher. A History of American Music: Soul and R&amp;B. Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, Aaron. American R&amp;B: Gospel Grooves, Funky Drummers, and Soul Power. Minneapolis: Twenty-First Century Books, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is almost inappropriate to categorize Christian R&amp;B as a subgenre under R&amp;B. It almost seem as if R&amp;B should be the subgenre of gospel music. But because R&amp;B is rooted in several music genres and have matured and evolved over decades, its musical characteristics are audibly different from the musical nuances of gospel music. It is ironic, but still conceivable, for a musician today to mix R&amp;B elements with gospel music elements.

R&amp;B originated between the 1940s and 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Handyside, Christopher. ''A History of American Music: Soul and R&amp;B''. Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian R&amp;B followed behind. Christian rhythm and blues has the same musical characteristics heard in regular or secular R&amp;B music, and change with the times as R&amp;B change with the times. The only difference between the two are the lyrics. Some Christians who perform R&amp;B may not explicitly mention God, Jesus Christ, or other overt religious terms, but their lyrics may still fit the standards of ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù or may be ethically neutral.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

A few early gospel R&amp;B musicians can be pointed out as far back as the 1950s. One R&amp;B vocal group, for example, known as [[the Orioles]], sung ‚Äúgospel-styled reworkings of songs that had been popular country, blues, or R&amp;B songs.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Handyside, Christopher. ''A History of American Music: Soul and R&amp;B'' (p. 8). Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the Orioles recorded a gospel song called ''Crying in the Chapel'', yet, the band was considered as R&amp;B.

A strong influence merging gospel and R&amp;B came from [[Sam Cooke]]. He started out as the lead singer for the gospel group [[Soul Stirrers]], but had always loved blues and jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woog|first1=Adam|title=The History of Gospel Music|date=2014|publisher=Lucent Books|location=Farmington Hills, MI|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; He'd incorporate elements from these two music styles into his gospel recordings. Even though he was making a nice living, he wanted to venture into secular music. In 1956, for fear he would upset his fans, band mates, and his record label, he released his first R&amp;B single (called ''Lovable'') under the assumed name ''Dale Cooke''. Because his voice is distinctive, people weren't fooled by the name Dale Cooke.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}	

Soon, other singers followed Cooke's footsteps, crossing over from gospel to R&amp;B/soul and merging the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woog|first1=Adam|title=The History of Gospel Music|date=2014|publisher=Lucent Books|location=Farmington Hills, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Charles]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[James Brown]] are other important figures who combined gospel and R&amp;B.

In the early ages of R&amp;B, the musicality distinguishing gospel from R&amp;B was blurred. There was little or no way to tell whether a person was listening to gospel music or R&amp;B music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woog|first1=Adam|title=The History of Gospel Music|date=2014|publisher=Lucent Books|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=83‚Äì84}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they paid close attention to the lyrics.

== Public Reaction and Acceptance ==
The success of a person‚Äôs Christian music is partly based on how the songs are composed and who are performing those songs. Even secular R&amp;B artists are known to record Christian music.&lt;ref&gt;Breezy, Elle. &quot;The R&amp;B-Gospel Connection: 10 Artists Who Straddle the Line.&quot; . Singersroom, 17 Mar. 2013. Web. 29 July 2014. &lt;http://singersroom.com/content/2013-03-17/The-RB-Gospel-Connection-10-Artists-Who-Straddle-the-Line/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadet, Alesha . &quot;Secular Artists Singing Gospel: Is That Okay?.&quot; . Tribune 242, 21 Feb. 2013. Web. 29 July 2014. &lt;http://www.tribune242.com/news/2013/feb/21/secular-artists-singing-gospel-is-that-okay/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are Christian singers with a balanced R&amp;B and contemporary gospel blend whereas other singers fuse [[hip-hop]] with R&amp;B, a combination that‚Äôs been in existence since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Jack Swing.&quot; . Wikipedia, 17 July 2014. Web. 30 July 2014. &lt;[[New jack swing&gt;.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hip Hop Soul.&quot; . Wikipedia, 30 July 2014. Web. 30 July 2014. &lt;[[Hip hop soul&gt;.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Singers in the former will mainly attract those who prefer gospel music, and singers in the latter appeal to those who favor hip-hop and contemporary R&amp;B. Some artists, like [[Canton Jones]], tend to alternate between both combinations, which may have garnered him a relatively larger audience than those who fuse gospel sounds only or hip-hop sounds only.

=== Religious Reaction ===
Many people continuously listen to their favorite style of music after professing their Christian faith. They begin to find sacred music of the same genre. This would mean that those who listen to R&amp;B music would still do so after their religious conversion. They'd embrace artists like [[J. Moss]], [[Canton Jones]], [[Mary Mary]], [[One Nation Crew]], [http://www.pajam-music.com/2103.html 21:03], [[Mali Music (singer)|Mali Music]], [http://www.cynthiajones.com/ Cynthia Jones], and [[Debra Killings]].

Some Christian circles believe certain musical styles are inherently evil, even if positive lyrics are being sung over the music.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Jerry. &quot;Music and the Christian.&quot; Music and the Christian.

In 2012, gospel singer Johnny Mo appeared on Christian television program Atlanta Live singing a spiritualized cleaned-up version of R. Kelly‚Äôs 1994 hit [[Bump n' Grind (R. Kelly song)|Bump n' Grind]]. The song is entitled ''I Don‚Äôt See Nothing Wrong with Living for Jesus''.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Drenna. &quot;He Sees 'Nothing Wrong': Check Out Johnny Mo Singing a Gospel Song To The Tune of &quot;Bump-N-Grind&quot;.&quot; MadameNoire RSS.

One of the issues that some Christian music listeners may have with listening to Christianized versions of secular music is that the newer Christian version may cause the listener to have a flashback, tempting that listener to commit behaviors they no longer wish to enact.&lt;ref&gt;Stetzer, Ed. &quot;7 Biblical Tests for Christians and Music.&quot; . Christianity Today, 5 June 2013. Web. 30 July 2014. &lt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2013/june/7-biblical-tests-for-christians-and-music.html?paging=off&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular Reaction ===
Devout Christians are not the only ones enjoying Christian/gospel music. As one blogger who claims to be a Black atheist said, &quot;It‚Äôs not about the message.  It‚Äôs about the sound and the feeling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Angelo|first1=Rafi|title=Why I love gospel music|url=http://soletstalkabout.com/post/58610352386/why-i-love-gospel-music|website=So Let's Talk About (SLTA)|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that although he doesn't believe in a god nor in the testimonies of gospel artists, he accepts gospel music because it is rooted in his African heritage.

It is generally known that people listen to music that they can relate to. In this case, non-Christians and those who aren't serious about the faith may sometimes come across Christian music that affects them emotionally (giving them hope) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cusic|first1=Don|title=Sound of Light|date=2002|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, WI|pages=181‚Äì182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woog|first1=Adam|title=The History of Gospel Music|date=2014|publisher=Lucent Books|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=57‚Äì58}}&lt;/ref&gt; or entertainment-wise (loving the style of music without necessarily caring for the lyrics).

[[Mary Mary]], the R&amp;B/Gospel singing duo, released their [[God in Me|God In Me]] single in 2008, featuring [[Kierra Sheard|Kierra &quot;KiKi&quot; Sheard]].

[[Yolanda Adams]] is another popular R&amp;B/Gospel singer, whose successes include four albums that reached the top 10 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Billboard chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431640/yolanda-adams/chart?f=333|website=Billboard Magazine|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her album ''Mountain High, Valley Low'' was on the chart for 94 weeks and peaked at #5. Her album ''Believe'' remained on the chart for 67 weeks and peaked at #7. ''Day By Day'' charted for 58 weeks and peaked at #4, and ''The Best of Me'' peaked at #9 while being on the chart for 18 weeks.

Without going into further chart performances for other R&amp;B/Gospel musicians, the two examples above reveal that these songs/albums were not only played on gospel channels, and that they were received by secular audiences.

'''Secular music'''; ''[[Secular]]'' means being separate from (not associated or concerned with) religion. In the [[Western world|West]], secular music developed in the [[Medieval period]] and was used in the [[Renaissance]]. Swaying authority from the [[Christian Church|Church]] that focused more on [[Common Law]] influenced all aspects of Medieval life, including music. Secular music in the [[Middle Ages]] included love songs, [[political satire]], dances, and dramatic works. [[Drum]]s, [[harp]]s, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, and [[bagpipes]] were the [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used in secular music because they were easy for the traveling musicians to tote about. Instruments were taught through oral tradition and provided great dancing music and accompanied the stanzas well.

Words are an important part of secular music. Words were added for most and many common people to sing songs together for entertainment. Music styles were changed by [[secularization]]. The [[motet]], for example, moved out of the Church and into the courts of nobility which then caused the motet to be forbidden in the Church. The largest collection of secular music from this period comes from poems of celebration and [[chivalry]] of the [[troubadour]]s from the south of France. These poems contain clever rhyme-schemes, varied use of refrain-lines or words, and different [[Metre (music)|metric]] patterns.

[[Composers]] like [[Josquin des Prez]] wrote sacred and secular music. He composed 86 highly successful secular works and 119 sacred pieces. Secular music also was aided by the formation of [[literature]] during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] that included a collection of secular and semi-secular songs.

[[Image:Ec-hasslau.de 010.jpg|190px|thumb|To emphasize the emotional aspect of a power ballad, crowds customarily hold up [[lighter]]s adjusted to produce a large flame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4D8173AF932A35751C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print &quot;POP VIEW; The Male Rock Anthem: Going All to Pieces&quot;].

'''Sentimental ballads''', sometimes called &quot;tear-jerkers&quot; or &quot;drawing-room [[ballad]]s&quot;, had their origins in the early &quot;[[Tin Pan Alley]]&quot; music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, [[Strophic form|strophic]] songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]], descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]].

As new genres of music, such as [[ragtime]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]], began to emerge in the early 20th century the popularity of this genre faded, but the association with sentimentality led to the term ballad being used for a slow [[love song]] from the 1950s onwards. Today, sentimental ballads are primarily known as '''pop ballads''', '''rock ballads''' or '''power ballads''', and they often deal with [[romance (love)|romantic]] and [[sexual relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;Witmer. See also Middleton (I,4,i).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the [[Victorian era]], ''ballad'' had come to mean any sentimental popular song, especially so-called &quot;royalty ballads&quot;. Some of [[Stephen Foster]]'s songs exemplify this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Temperley (II,2).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, composers of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] used ''ballad'' to signify a slow, sentimental tune or love song, often written in a fairly standardized form. Jazz musicians sometimes broaden the term still further to embrace all slow-tempo pieces.

Notable historical ballads include, &quot;Little Rosewood Casket&quot; (1870), &quot;[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]&quot; (1892), and &quot;[[Danny Boy]]&quot; (1913).&lt;ref name=Cohen2005p297&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the word ''ballad'' appears in the title of a song, as for example in [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]&quot; (1969) or [[Billy Joel]]'s &quot;[[The Ballad of Billy the Kid]]&quot; (1974), the [[folk music]] sense is generally implied. The term ''ballad'' is also sometimes applied to strophic story-songs more generally, such as [[Don McLean]]'s &quot;[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]&quot; (1971).&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Adams, ''Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland Connection Music of the Great Lakes'' (Kent State University Press, 2002), ISBN 0-87338-691-4, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
Pop ballads tend to have a lush arrangement, emphasizing [[melody]] and [[harmony|harmonies]]. They are usually melodic enough to get the listener's attention and may also work well as [[background music]]. Ballads tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[verse‚Äìchorus form|verse‚Äìchorus structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm|title=Pop Music - What Is Pop Music - A Definition and Brief History|publisher=Top40.about.com|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ballads mostly use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments such as [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[piano]]s, [[saxophones]], and sometimes an [[orchestral]] set. The [[electric guitar]]s are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent ballads often feature [[synthesizer]]s and other electronics, such as [[drum machines]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954-1984'' (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jazz and traditional pop==
Most [[traditional pop music|pop standard]] and jazz ballads are built from a single, introductory ''verse'', usually around 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] in length, and they end on the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] - the ''chorus'' or ''[[refrain]]'', usually 16 or 32 bars long and in [[AABA form]] (though other forms, such as ABAC, are not uncommon). In AABA forms, the B section is usually referred to as the ''[[bridge (music)|bridge]]''; often a brief ''[[coda (music)|coda]]'', sometimes based on material from the bridge, is added, as in &quot;[[Over the Rainbow]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;D. Randel, ''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music'', (Cambridge MS: Harvard University Press, 1986) ISBN 0-674-61525-5, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of notable pop and jazz ballads include: 
&quot;[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]&quot; (1925) by [[Irving Berlin]], 
&quot;[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]&quot; by [[Billie Holiday]] (1941), 
&quot;[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]&quot; (1945) by [[Cole Porter]], 
&quot;[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]&quot; (1945) by [[Nat King Cole]], 
&quot;[[You Mean Everything to Me (song)|You Mean Everything to Me]]&quot; (1960) by [[Neil Sedaka]], 
&quot;[[My Way]]&quot; (1968) by [[Frank Sinatra]], 
&quot;[[Windmills of your Mind]]&quot; (1968) by [[Noel Harrison]], 
&quot;[[If You Go Away]]&quot; (1968) by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], 
&quot;[[(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story]]&quot; (1970) by [[Andy Williams]], 
&quot;[[Speak Softly Love]]&quot; (1972) by [[Andy Williams]], 
&quot;[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]&quot; by [[Roberta Flack]] (1973), and 
&quot;[[I Will Wait For You]]&quot; (1998) by [[Connie Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Forte, ''The American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era, 1924-1950'' (Princeton University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pop and R&amp;B ballads==
The most common use of the term ballad in modern [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B music]] is for an emotional song about romance, breakup and/or longing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen2005p297&quot;/&gt; Some notable examples of pop ballads include: [[Celine Dion]]'s &quot;[[My Heart Will Go On]]&quot;, [[Elton John]]'s &quot;[[Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word]]&quot;, [[Delta Goodrem]]'s &quot;[[Lost Without You]]&quot;, and [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s &quot;[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/467487/is-adeles-someone-like-you-the-first-no-1-piano-and-vocal-only|title=Is Adele's 'Someone Like You' The First No. 1 Piano-And-Vocal-Only Ballad? |date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2012|last=Trust|first=Gary|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of notable R&amp;B ballads include [[Mariah Carey]]'s &quot;[[My All]]&quot;, [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]'s &quot;[[The Way That I Love You]]&quot;, [[The Pussycat Dolls]]' &quot;[[Hush Hush]]&quot;, [[Rihanna]]'s &quot;[[Unfaithful (Rihanna song)|Unfaithful]]&quot;, and [[Toni Braxton]]'s &quot;[[Un-Break My Heart]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.midem.com/2011/01/interview-diane-warren-the-fiercely-independent-hitmaker/|title=Interview: Diane Warren, the &quot;fiercely independent&quot; hitmaker| last=Midemblog| first=James| date=January 13, 2011| accessdate=March 24, 2012| publisher=Midem Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power ballads==
[[Simon Frith]], the British [[Sociomusicology|sociomusicologist]] and former rock critic, identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of [[Soul music|soul]] artists, particularly [[Ray Charles]], and the adaptation of this style by performers such as [[Eric Burdon]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and [[Joe Cocker]] to produce slow-tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars, and sometimes choirs.&lt;ref name=Frithpop/&gt; According to Charles Aaron, power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences.&lt;ref name=aaron&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaron|first=Charles|editors=Jonathan Lethem, Paul Bresnick|title=Da Capo Best Music Writing 2002: The Year's Finest Writing on Rock, Pop, Jazz, Country,and More|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|chapter=Don't Fight the Power|year=2002|isbn=978-0-306-81166-1|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron argues that the power ballad broke into the [[mainstream]] of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier songs such as [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Stairway to Heaven]]&quot; (1971), [[Aerosmith]]'s &quot;[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]&quot; (1973), and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s &quot;[[Free Bird]]&quot; (1974).&lt;ref name=aaron/&gt; [[The Carpenters]]' &quot;[[Goodbye to Love]]&quot; (1972) has also been identified as a [[prototype]] of the power ballad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perrone |first=Pierre |title=Tony Peluso: Guitarist whose solos on The Carpenters' 'Goodbye to Love' ushered in the power-ballad era|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tony-peluso-guitarist-whose-solos-on-the-carpenters-goodbye-to-love-ushered-in-the-powerballad-era-2041048.html|accessdate=February 4, 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable power ballad examples include [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]'s version of &quot;[[Love Hurts]]&quot; (1975),&lt;ref name=Frithpop&gt;S. Frith, &quot;Pop Music&quot; in S. Frith, W. Straw and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart (band)|Heart]]'s &quot;[[What About Love]]&quot; (1985)&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock: the definitive guide to more than 1200 artists and bands'' (Rough Guides, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]'s &quot;[[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]]&quot; (1988).&lt;ref&gt;H. George-Warren, P. Romanowski and J. Pareles, ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' (Fireside, 3rd edn., 2001), p. 1060.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journey's power ballad, &quot;Faithfully&quot;, a late addition to the group's ''Frontiers'' (1983) album, inspired Prince, who obtained the blessing of Journey's singer/songwriter [[Jonathan Cain]], before releasing what was to become Prince's signature song, &quot;[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]&quot; (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles|work=Billboard|title=Why Prince asked for Journey's Blessing Before Releasing 'Purple Rain'|date=April 26, 2016 |author=Graf, Gary Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pastoral''' lifestyle (see [[pastoralism]]) is that of shepherds [[herd]]ing livestock around open areas of [[Landscape|land]] according to [[season]]s and the changing availability of water and pasture. It lends its name to a [[genre]] of literature, art and music that depicts such life in an idealized manner, typically for [[Urban culture|urban audiences]]. A ''pastoral'' is a work of this [[genre]], also known as '''bucolic''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ}}, from {{lang|grc|Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫œåŒªŒøœÇ}}, meaning a [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|boukoliko/s|Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ|ref}}. {{LSJ|bouko/los|Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫œåŒªŒøœÇ|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bucolic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoral literature==

===Pastoral literature in general===
Pastoral is a [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of literature in which the author employs various techniques to place the complex life into a simple one.  Paul Alpers distinguishes pastoral as a mode rather than a genre, and he bases this distinction on the recurring attitude of power; that is to say that pastoral literature holds a humble perspective toward nature.  Thus, pastoral as a mode occurs in many types of literature (poetry, drama, etc.) as well as genres (most notably the pastoral elegy).

Terry Gifford, a prominent literary theorist, defines pastoral in three ways in his critical book ''Pastoral''. The first way emphasizes the historical literary perspective of the pastoral in which authors recognize and discuss life in the country and in particular the life of a shepherd.&lt;ref name = Gifford1-12&gt;{{cite book |last=Gifford |first=Terry |title=Pastoral |location=London; New York |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |series=The New Critical Idiom |isbn=0415147328 |pages=1‚Äì12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is summed up by [[Leo Marx]] with the phrase &quot;No shepherd, no pastoral.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gifford1-12&quot;/&gt; The second type of the pastoral is literature that &quot;describes the country with an implicit or explicit contrast to the urban.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gifford1-12&quot;/&gt; The third type of pastoral depicts the country life with derogative classifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gifford1-12&quot;/&gt;

[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' presents a 'golden age' when people lived together  in harmony with nature. This [[Golden Age]] shows that even before [[Alexandria]], ancient Greeks had sentiments of an ideal pastoral life that they had already lost. This is the first example of literature that has pastoral sentiments and may have begun the pastoral tradition. [[Ovid's Metamorphoses]] is much like the ''Works and Days'' with the description of ages (golden, silver, brazen, iron and human) but with more ages to discuss and less emphasis on the gods and their punishments. In this artificially constructed world, nature acts as the main punisher. Another example of this perfect relationship between man and nature is evident in the encounter of a shepherd and a goatherd who meet in the pastures in [[Theocritus]]' poem ''Idylls 1''.
Traditionally, pastoral refers to the lives of herdsmen in a romanticized, exaggerated, but representative way.  In [[literature]], the adjective 'pastoral' refers to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside among [[shepherd]]s, [[Pastoral farming|cowherds]] and other farm workers that are often [[romanticism|romanticized]] and depicted in a highly unrealistic manner. The pastoral life is usually characterized as being closer to the [[Golden age]] than the rest of human life. The setting is a [[Locus Amoenus]], or a beautiful place in nature, sometimes connected with images of the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year,'' p 96, ISBN 0-271-01904-2&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of the use of the genre is the short poem by the 15th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[makar]] [[Robert Henryson]] ''[[Robene and Makyne]]'' which also contains the conflicted emotions often present in the genre. A more tranquil mood is set by [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s well known lines from ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'':

:''Come live with me and be my Love,''
:''And we will all the pleasures prove''
:''That hills and valleys, dale and field,''
:''And all the craggy mountains yield.&quot;

:''There will we sit upon the rocks''
:''And see the shepherds feed their flocks,''
:''By shallow rivers, to whose falls''
:''Melodious birds sing madrigals.''

&quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; exhibits the concept of Gifford's second definition of pastoral. The speaker of the poem, who is the titled shepherd, draws on the idealization of urban material pleasures to win over his love rather than resorting to the simplified pleasures of pastoral ideology. This can be seen in the listed items: &quot;lined slippers,&quot; &quot;purest gold,&quot; &quot;silver dishes,&quot; and &quot;ivory table&quot; (lines 13, 15, 16, 21, 23). The speaker takes on a voyeuristic point of view with his love, and they are not directly interacting with the other true shepherds and nature.

Pastoral shepherds and maidens usually have [[Greek language|Greek]] names like [[Corydon (character)|Corydon]]  or Philomela, reflecting the origin of the pastoral genre. Pastoral poems are set in beautiful rural landscapes, the literary term for which is &quot;locus amoenus&quot; (Latin for &quot;beautiful place&quot;), such as [[Arcadia]], a rural region of [[Greece]], mythological home of the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], which was portrayed as a sort of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] by the poets.  The tasks of their employment with sheep and other rustic chores is held in the fantasy to be almost wholly undemanding and is left in the background, abandoning the shepherdesses and their swains in a state of almost perfect [[leisure]].  This makes them available for embodying perpetual [[erotica|erotic]] fantasies.  The shepherds spend their time chasing pretty girls &amp;mdash; or, at least in the Greek and Roman versions, pretty lads as well.  The eroticism of [[Virgil]]'s second [[eclogue]], ''Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin'' (&quot;The shepherd Corydon burned with passion for pretty Alexis&quot;) is entirely [[homosexual]], although the use of that term is [[anachronistic]] due to a lack of any idea of sexual identity in the times in which Virgil was writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Pastoral poetry===
[[File:Meister des Vergilius Romanus 001.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Georgics]] Book III, ''Shepherd with Flocks'', [[Vergil]] ([[Vatican Library]])]]
Pastoral literature continued after Hesiod with the [[poetry]] of the [[Hellenistic]] Greek [[Theocritus]], several of whose ''Idylls'' are set in the countryside (probably reflecting the landscape of the island of [[Kos|Cos]] where the poet lived) and involve dialogues between herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction (p.14) to Virgil: ''The Eclogues'' trans. Guy Lee (Penguin Classics)&lt;/ref&gt; Theocritus may have drawn on authentic folk traditions of Sicilian shepherds. He wrote in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] but the metre he chose was the [[dactylic hexameter]] associated with the most prestigious form of Greek poetry, [[Epic poetry|epic]]. This blend of simplicity and sophistication would play a major part in later pastoral verse. Theocritus was imitated by the Greek poets [[Bion of Smyrna|Bion]] and [[Moschus]].

The Roman poet [[Virgil]] adapted pastoral into Latin with his highly influential ''[[Eclogues]]''.  Virgil introduces two very important uses of pastoral, the contrast between urban and rural lifestyles and political allegory&lt;ref&gt;Article on &quot;Bucolic poetry&quot; in ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in Eclogues 1 and 4 respectively.  In doing so, Virgil presents a more idealized portrayal of the lives of shepherds while still employing the traditional pastoral conventions of Theocritus.  He was the first to set his poems in Arcadia, an idealized location to which much later pastoral literature will refer.

[[Horace]]'s The [[Epodes]], ii Country Joys has &quot;the dreaming man&quot; Alfius, who dreams of escaping his busy urban life for the peaceful country. But as &quot;the dreaming man&quot; indicates, this is just a dream for Alfius. He is too consumed in his career as a [[usurer]] to leave it behind for the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/HoraceEpodesAndCarmenSaeculare.htm#_Toc98670050 Horace's ''Delights of the Country'' Epode ii] Retrieved October 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Silver Latin]] poets who wrote pastoral poetry, modeled principally upon Virgil's Eclogues, include [[Titus Calpurnius Siculus|Calpurnius Siculus]] and [[Nemesianus]].

Italian poets revived the pastoral from the 14th century onwards, first in Latin (examples include works by [[Petrarch]], [[Pontano]] and [[Baptista Mantuanus|Mantuan]]) then in the Italian vernacular ([[Jacopo Sannazaro|Sannazaro]], [[Boiardo]]). The fashion for pastoral spread throughout Renaissance Europe. In Spain, [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] was an important pioneer and his motifs find themselves renewed in the 20th century Spanish language poet [[Giannina Braschi]].  Leading French pastoral poets include [[Cl√©ment Marot|Marot]] and [[Pierre Ronsard|Ronsard]].
[[File:Blake shepherd.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist, illustrator and poet William Blake's hand painted print illustrating his pastoral poem &quot;[[The Shepherd (Blake)|The Shepherd]]&quot; depicts the pastoral scene of a shepherd watching his flock with a shepherd's crook.

The first pastorals in English were the ''[[Eclogues]]'' (c. 1515) of [[Alexander Barclay]], which were heavily influenced by [[Mantuan]]. A landmark in English pastoral poetry was [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]‚Äôs ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'', first published in 1579. Spenser's work consists of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year, and is written in dialect. It contains [[elegy|elegies]], [[fable]]s and a discussion of the role of poetry in contemporary England. Spenser and his friends appear under various pseudonyms (Spenser himself is &quot;Colin Clout&quot;). Spenser's example was imitated by such poets as [[Michael Drayton]] (''Idea, The Shepherd's Garland'') and [[William Browne (poet)|William Browne]] (''Britannia's Pastorals''). During this period of England's history, many authors explored &quot;anti-pastoral&quot; themes. Two examples of this is [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ‚ÄúThe Twenty-Third Psalm‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Nightingale‚Äù focus on the world in a very anti-pastoral view. In ‚ÄúThe Twenty-Third Psalm,‚Äù Nature is portrayed as something we need to be protected from, and in ‚ÄúThe Nightingale,‚Äù the woe of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] is compared to the speaker's own pain. Additionally, he wrote ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' which is filled with pastoral descriptions of the landscape. &quot;[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]&quot; (1600) by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] also comments on the anti-pastoral as the nymph responds realistically to the idealizing shepherd of ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'' by embracing and explaining the true course of nature and its incompatibility with the love that the Shepherd yearns for with the nymph.

In the 17th century came the arrival of the [[Country house poem]]. Included in this genre is [[Aemilia Lanyer]]‚Äôs ''The Description of Cooke-ham'' in 1611, in which a woman is described in terms of her relationship to her estate and how it mourns for her when she leaves it.  In 1616, [[Ben Jonson]] wrote ''To Penshurst,'' a poem in which he addresses the estate owned by the Sidney family and tells of its beauty. The basis of the poem is a harmonious and joyous elation of the memories that Jonson had at the manor. It is beautifully written with iambic pentameter, a style that Jonson so eloquently uses to describe the culture of Penshurst.  It is very important to note the insertion of Pan and Bacchus as notable company of the manor. Pan, Greek god of the Pastoral world, half man and half goat, was connected with both hunting and shepherds; [[Bacchus]] was the god of wine, intoxication and ritual madness.  This reference to Pan and Bacchus in a pastoral view demonstrates how prestigious Penshurst was, to be worthy in the company with gods, notions of just how romanticized the estate was. 

&quot;A Country Life&quot;, another 17th century work by [[Katherine Philips]], was also a country house poem. Philips focuses on the joys of the countryside and looks upon the lifestyle that accompanies it as being  &quot;the first and happiest life, when man enjoyed himself.&quot;  She writes about maintaining this lifestyle by living detached from material things, and by not over-concerning herself with the world around her.  [[Andrew Marvell]]'s &quot;[[Upon Appleton House]]&quot; was written when Marvell was working as a tutor for Lord Fairfax's daughter Mary, in 1651.  The poem is very rich with metaphors that relate to religion, politics and history.  Similar to Jonson's &quot;To Penshurst&quot;, Marvell's poem is describing a pastoral estate.  It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future.  Marvell used nature as a thread to weave together a poem centered around man.  We once again see nature fully providing for man.  Marvell also continuously compares nature to art and seems to point out that art can never accomplish on purpose what nature can achieve accidentally or spontaneously.

[[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'s ''The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home'' was also written in the 17th century. In this pastoral work, he paints the reader a colorful picture of the benefits reaped from hard work.  This is an atypical interpretation of the pastoral, given that there is a celebration of labor involved as opposed to central figures living in leisure and nature just taking its course independently.  This poem was mentioned in [[Raymond Williams]]', ''The Country and the City''.  This acknowledgment of Herrick's work is appropriate, as both Williams and Herrick accentuate the importance of labor in the pastoral lifestyle.

The [[Pastoral Elegy]] is a subgenre that uses pastoral elements to lament a death or loss. The most famous pastoral elegy in English is [[John Milton]]'s &quot;[[Lycidas]]&quot; (1637), written on the death of Edward King, a fellow student at Cambridge University. Milton used the form both to explore his vocation as a writer and to attack what he saw as the abuses of the Church. Also included is [[Thomas Gray]]'s, &quot;Elegy on a Country Churchyard&quot; (1750).

The formal English pastoral continued to flourish during the 18th century, eventually dying out at the end. One notable example of an 18th-century work is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Pastorals'' (1709). In this work Pope imitates [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''Shepheardes Calendar'', while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with [[Virgil]]. In 1717, Pope's ''Discourse on Pastoral Poetry'' was published as a preface to ''Pastorals.'' In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Phillips.  During this time period [[Ambrose Phillips]], who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the Native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man.  He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature.  As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature.  [[John Gay]], who came a little later was criticized for his poem's artificiality by [[Samuel Johnson|Doctor Johnson]] and attacked for their lack of realism by [[George Crabbe]], who attempted to give a true picture of rural life in his poem ''The Village.''  

In 1590, Edmund Spenser also composed a very famous pastoral epic called ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', in which he employs the pastoral mode to accentuate the charm, lushness, and splendor of the poem's (super)natural world.  Spenser alludes to the pastoral continuously throughout the work and also uses it to create allegory in his poem, with the characters as well as with the environment, both of which are meant to have symbolic meaning in the real world.  It is composed of six books but Spenser intended to write twelve.  He wrote the poem primarily to honor [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]]. [[William Cowper]] addressed the artificiality of the fast paced city life in his poems ''Retirement'' (1782) and ''The Winter Nosegay'' (1782). Pastoral nevertheless survived as a mood rather than a genre, as can be seen from such works as [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''Thyrsis'' (1867), a lament on the death of his fellow poet [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]. [[Robert Burns]] can be read as a Pastoral poet for his nostalgic portrayals of rural Scotland and simple farm life in ''To A Mouse'' and ''The Cotter's Saturday Night''. Burns explicitly addresses the Pastoral form in his ''Poem on Pastoral Poetry''. In this he champions his fellow Scot [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsey]] as the best Pastoral poet since [[Theocritus]].

Another subgenre is the Edenic Pastoral, which alludes to the perfect relationship between God, man, and nature in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It typically includes biblical symbols and imagery. In 1645 John Milton wrote ''[[L'Allegro]]'', which translates as the happy person. It is a celebration of [[Mirth]] personified, who is the child of love and revelry. It was originally composed to be a companion poem to, ''[[Il Penseroso]]'', which celebrates a life of melancholy and solitude. Milton's, ''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]'' (1629) blends Christian and pastoral imagery.

====Pastoral epic====
Milton is perhaps best known for his epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', one of the few Pastoral epics ever written. A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan‚Äôs trespass into paradise. Milton‚Äôs iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan‚Äôs perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of [[Adam and Eve]]‚Äôs pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve's care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to Satan, constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience‚Äôs understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‚Äòtruths‚Äô they hold for themselves.

===Pastoral romances===
Italian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose. Although there was no classical precedent for the form, it drew some inspiration from ancient Greek novels set in the countryside, such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]''. The most influential Italian example of the form was [[Sannazzaro]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1504). The vogue for the pastoral romance spread throughout Europe producing such notable works as [[Bernardim Ribeiro]] &quot;Menina e Mo√ßa&quot; (1554) in Portuguese,&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Charles Dudley|title=A Library of the World's Best Literature - Ancient and Modern - Vol.XLIII|year=2008|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=1-60520-251-7|pages=456|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j6k3F_89oyEC&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=bernardim%20ribeiro%20pastoral%20romance%20menina%20e%20mo%C3%A7a&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge de Montemayor|Montemayor]]'s [[Diana (pastoral romance)|''Diana'']] (1559) in Spain, [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1590) in England, and [[Honor√© d'Urf√©]]'s ''Astr√©e'' (1607‚Äì27) in France.

===Pastoral plays===
[[File:John Reinhard Weguelin ‚Äì A Pastoral (1905).jpg|thumb|275px|&lt;center&gt;''A Pastoral'' (watercolour, 1905)&lt;br&gt;by [[John Reinhard Weguelin]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Pastoral drama also emerged in Renaissance Italy. Again, there was little Classical precedent, with the possible exception of Greek [[satyr play]]s. [[Poliziano]]'s ''Orfeo'' (1480) shows the beginnings of the new form, but it reached its zenith in the late 16th century with [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Aminta]]'' (1573), [[Isabella Andreini]]'s ''Mirtilla'' (1588), and [[Giambattista Guarini|Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' (1590). [[John Lyly]]'s ''Endimion'' (1579) brought the Italian-style pastoral play to England. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''The Sad Shepherd''  and Sidney's ''[[The Lady of May]]'' are later examples. Some of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays contain pastoral elements, most notably ''[[As You Like It]]'' (whose plot was derived from [[Thomas Lodge]]'s pastoral romance ''Rosalynde'') and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', of which Act 4 Scene 4 is a lengthy pastoral digression. 

The forest in ''As You Like It'' can be seen as a place of pastoral idealization, where life is simpler and purer, and its inhabitants live more closely to each other, nature and God than their urban counterparts. However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate pastoralism. His protagonists [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] and [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]] metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love. She is the only character throughout the play who embraces and appreciates both the real and idealized life and manages to make the two ideas coexist. Therefore, Shakespeare explores city and country life as being appreciated through the coexistence of the two.

==Pastoral music==
Theocritus's ''Idylls'' include strophic songs and musical laments, and, as in [[Homer]], his shepherds often play the [[syrinx]], or [[Pan flute]], considered a quintessentially pastoral instrument. Virgil's ''Eclogues'' were performed as sung mime in the 1st century, and there is evidence of the pastoral song as a legitimate genre of classical times.

The pastoral genre was a significant influence in the development of [[opera]]. After settings of pastoral poetry in the [[pastourelle]] genre by the [[troubadour]]s, Italian poets and composers became increasingly drawn to the pastoral. Musical settings  of pastoral poetry became increasingly common in first polyphonic and then [[monodic]] [[madrigal]]s: these later led to the [[cantata]] and the [[serenata]], in which pastoral themes remained on a consistent basis. Partial musical settings of [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' were highly popular: the texts of over 500 madrigals were taken from this one play alone. [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''Aminta'' was also a favourite. As [[opera]] developed, the dramatic pastoral came to the fore with such works as [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Dafne]]'' and, most notably, [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]''. Pastoral opera remained popular throughout the 17th-century, and not just in Italy, as is shown by the French genre of ''[[pastorale h√©ro√Øque]]'', Englishman [[Henry Lawes]]'s music for [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (not to mention [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]''), and Spanish [[zarzuela]]. At the same time, Italian and German composers developed a genre of vocal and instrumental pastorals, distinguished by certain stylistic features, associated with Christmas Eve.

The pastoral, and parodies of the pastoral, continued to play an important role in musical history throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. [[John Gay]] may have satirized the pastoral in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', but also wrote an entirely sincere libretto for [[Handel]]'s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]''. [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Le Devin du village]]'' draws on pastoral roots, and [[Metastasio]]'s libretto ''[[Il re pastore]]'' was set over 30 times, most famously by [[Mozart]]. [[Rameau]] was an outstanding exponent of French pastoral opera.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cuthbert Girdlestone]], ''Jean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work'', particularly p.377 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beethoven]] also wrote his famous [[Pastoral Symphony]], avoiding his usual musical dynamism in favour of relatively slow rhythms. More concerned with psychology than description, he labelled the work &quot;more the expression of feeling than [realistic] painting&quot;. The pastoral also appeared as a feature of [[grand opera]], most particularly in Meyerbeer's operas: often composers would develop a pastoral-themed &quot;oasis&quot;, usually in the centre of their work. Notable examples include the shepherd's &quot;alte Weise&quot; from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''. The 20th-century continued to bring new pastoral interpretations, particularly in ballet, such as Ravel's ''Daphis and Chloe'', Nijinsky's use of Debussy's ''[[Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune]]'', and [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Le sacre du printemps]]'' and ''Les Noces''.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: [[Geoffrey Chew (musicologist)|Geoffrey Chew]] and Owen Jander (2001).

The [[Pastorale]] is a form of [[Italian folk music|Italian folk song]] still played in the regions of Southern Italy where the [[zampogna]] continues to thrive. They generally sound like a slowed down version of a [[tarantella]], as they encompass many of the same melodic phrases. The pastorale on the zampogna can be played by a solo zampogna player, or in some regions can be accompanied by the piffero (also commonly called a [[ciaramella]], 'pipita', or [[bifora]]), which is a primitive key-less double reed [[oboe]] type instrument.

==Pastoral art==
{{main|commons:Category:Shepherds in art}}
Idealised pastoral landscapes appear in Hellenistic and Roman wall paintings. Interest in the pastoral as a subject for art revived in Renaissance Italy, partly inspired by the descriptions of pictures Sannazzaro included in his ''Arcadia''. The ''F√™te champ√™tre'' (''Pastoral Symphony'') attributed to [[Giorgione]] is perhaps the most famous painting in this style. Later, French artists were also attracted to the pastoral, notably [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], [[Poussin]] (e.g. [[Et in Arcadia ego]]) and [[Watteau]] (in his ''F√™tes galantes'').&lt;ref&gt;Article on &quot;Pastoral&quot; in ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (ed. H. Osborne)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Cole]] has a series of paintings titled ''[[The Course of Empire]]'', and the second of these paintings (shown on the right) depicts the perfect pastoral setting.

==Pastoral theory==
In the past four hundred years, a range of writers have worked on theorizing the nature of pastoral.  These include [[Friedrich Schiller]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schiller, ''On Naive and Sentimental Poetry'' (1795).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Puttenham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;English Poesie 1589&quot;&gt;[[George Puttenham]], ''Arte of English Poesie'' (1589).&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Empson]],&lt;ref&gt;William Empson, ''Some Versions of Pastoral.'' (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Kermode]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode, ''English Pastoral Poetry: From the Beginnings to Marvell.''

[[George Puttenham]] was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to ‚Äúcontain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour‚Äù.&lt;ref name=&quot;English Poesie 1589&quot;/&gt;

[[Friedrich Schiller]] linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an ‚Äúimage of our infancy irrevocably past‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://schillerinstitute.org/transl/Schiller_essays/naive_sentimental-1.html|title = On Na√Øve and Sentimental Poetry|last = Schiller|first = Friedrich|website = The Schiller Institute|publisher = Translated by William F. Wertz, Jr|access-date = March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Empson]] spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as 'putting the complex into the simple.' Empson argues that &quot;. . . good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral&quot;, and uses Soviet Russia's propaganda about the working class as evidence.  Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.

[[Raymond Williams]] argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a &quot;myth functioning as a memory&quot; that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city's relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country new-comers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside.  With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the &quot;inheritance of titles and making of family names&quot;.

[[Renato Poggioli|Poggioli]] was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as 'funeral elegy', the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In ''[[The Oaten Flue]]'', he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were ‚Äúan ideal kind of leisure class.&quot;

[[Frank Kermode]] discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance.  His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale urban sprawl left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living.  His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham. Kermode elaborates on this and says, &quot;the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life&quot;. Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it  as &quot;one of the fundamental laws of literary history&quot; because it &quot;gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition&quot;. Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle.  This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.

Annabel Patterson emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil‚Äôs Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius' Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil's Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of [[Robert Frost]] on pastoral ideology. His poem, ''Build Soil'' is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, &quot;turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration&quot;. [[William Wordsworth]] was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, ''Prelude,'' published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.

Paul Alpers, in his 1996 book, ''What is Pastoral?'', describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds.  With William Empson's notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory.  Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature.  Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters.  However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers.  Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says &quot;a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place‚Ä≥. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd.  And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in ''The Garden''.  Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in ''L‚ÄôAllegro''. Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts ‚Äúnormal‚Äù narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil‚Äôs works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.

In ''What Else Is Pastoral?'', Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of nature writing than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance Pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.

A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 &quot;Genre&quot;]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janice Wong|year=2011|title=Visualising Music: The Problems with Genre Classification|website=http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2011/04/26/visualising-music-the-problems-with-genre-classification/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}} The creator of taking Ls&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word &quot;form&quot;, as part of the compound expression ; the word &quot;style&quot; does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, &quot;Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre ‚Äì both are violin concertos ‚Äì but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or &quot;basic musical language.&quot;&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-4224(200108)82%3A3%3C432%3ACCIMDS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-D &quot;Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre&quot;]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432‚Äì442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, &quot;genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the criteria often used to classify musical genres are the trichotomy of art, popular, and traditional musics.

==The art/popular/traditional distinction==
Musicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomic distinction such as Philip Tagg's &quot;axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41&quot;&gt;Tagg, Philip. &quot;Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice&quot;. ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41&quot;/&gt;

===Art music===
{{Main|Art music}}
{{See also|List of art music traditions}}

The term ''art music'' refers primarily to classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction&lt;ref&gt;Siron, Jacques. &quot;Musique Savante (Serious Music)&quot;. ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis&quot;&gt;Arnold, Denis: &quot;Art Music, Art Song&quot;, in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.&lt;/ref&gt; preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, Philip. &quot;Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice&quot;. ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37‚Äì67, here 41‚Äì42.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a &quot;work&quot; or &quot;piece&quot; of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music.

Sacred [[Christian music]] forms an important part of the classical music tradition and repertoire, but can also be considered to have an identity of its own.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--And why just Christian music?--&gt;

===Popular music===
{{Main|Popular music}}

The term ''popular music'' refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the [[mass media]]. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&amp;nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popular music is found on most commercial radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.

The distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Denis (1983): &quot;Art Music, Art Song&quot;, in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, ISBN 0-19-311316-3.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics. Background music for films/movies often draws on both traditions. In this respect music is like fiction, which likewise draws a distinction between [[literary fiction]] and [[popular fiction]] that is not always precise.

===Traditional music===
{{Main|Traditional music}}

''Traditional music'' is a modern name for what has been called &quot;[[folk music]]&quot;, excluding the expansion of the term ''folk music'' to include much non-traditional material. Sometimes &quot;folk&quot; is designated for Western music and non-Western music is considered &quot;[[world music]]&quot;. The two are both unified as traditional music due to:
*[[Oral tradition|Oral transmission]]: The music is handed down and learned through singing, listening, and sometimes dancing;
*Cultural basis: The music derives from and is part of the traditions of a particular region or culture.

===Critics of the axiomatic triangle===
Musicologist and popular music specialist [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] has discussed the blurred nature of these distinctions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neat divisions between 'folk' and 'popular', and 'popular' and 'art', are impossible to find ... arbitrary criteria [are used] to define the complement of 'popular'. 'Art' music, for example, is generally regarded as by nature complex, difficult, demanding; 'popular' music then has to be defined as 'simple', 'accessible', 'facile'. But many pieces commonly thought of as 'art' (Handel's 'Hallelujah Chorus', many Schubert songs, many Verdi arias) have qualities of simplicity; conversely, it is by no means obvious that the [[Sex Pistols]]' records were 'accessible', [[Frank Zappa]]'s work 'simple', or [[Billie Holiday]]'s 'facile'.&lt;ref name=Middleton&gt;{{cite book |title=Studying Popular Music |last=Middleton |first=Richard |year=1990 |publisher=[[Open University Press]] |isbn=978-0-335-15275-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Automatic categorization===
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}

Automatic methods of musical similarity detection, based on [[data mining]] and [[co-occurrence]] analysis, have been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, Fran√ßois; Westermann, Geert; Laigre, Damien. [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf &quot;Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution&quot;]. ''Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference''sou, pp. 101-106, Firenze, Italy, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of new genres and subgenres==
New genres can arise by the development of new forms and styles of music and also simply by creating a new categorization. Although it is conceivable to create a musical style with no relation to existing genres, new styles usually appear under the influence of preexisting genres. The [[genealogy of musical genres]] expresses, often in the form of a written chart, the way in which new genres have developed under the influence of older ones. If two or more existing genres influence the emergence of a new one, a fusion between them can be said to have taken place. The proliferation of popular music in the 20th century has led to over 1,200 definable subgenres of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Dark Alternative Music''' is music that is &quot;dark&quot; (in the [[Darkness#Literature|metaphorical sense of darkness]]) and &quot;alternative&quot; (in the sense of being a [[Alternative music|musical alternative]] to more conventional or popular forms). In [[Germany]], this genre falls under the term ''schwarze szene'', which &quot;translates to 'black scene' and [has been] used since the 1990s to describe all the so called dark alternative music styles swirling around Goth: industrial, darkwave, electro, metal, neofolk and medieval, and for some reason also including [[BDSM]]/[[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Liisa Ladouceur, Gary Pullin, &quot;SCHWARZE SZENE&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia Gothica'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of dark alternative music include:
* Dark 2-step, a derivate of [[2-step garage]]
* [[Darkcore]], a subgenre of [[oldschool jungle|jungle]]
* [[Dark ambient]], a subgenre of [[ambient music|ambient]]
* [[Dark cabaret]], a fusion between [[punk rock|punk]] and [[cabaret]]
* Dark EBM, a subgenre of [[Electronic Body Music]]
* [[Dark electro]], an outgrowth of [[Electro-industrial]] and [[industrial music]]
* [[Dark folk]], an outgrowth of [[industrial music]]
* [[Dark metal]], variety of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subgenres
* [[Dark psytrance]], a subgenre of [[psychedelic trance]]

{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}
In [[European classical music|classical music]], a '''bravura''' is a style of both music and its performance intended to show off the skill of a [[performer]]. &lt;ref name=jafm&gt;[[John Alexander Fuller-Maitland]], ''A dictionary of music and musicians (A.D. 1450-1889)'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=J962AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 p. 271-272]&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly it is a [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] [[passage (music)|passage]] performed as a [[Solo (music)|solo]], and often in a [[cadenza]].

The term implies &quot;effect for effect's sake&quot;. Therefore while many pieces of Beethoven do require a high skill, they are not described as &quot;bravura&quot;.   Fuller-Maitland suggests the following arias as examples of bravura: ''[[Let the bright Seraphim]]'', &quot;Der H√∂lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen&quot; (Act II of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'') and &quot;Non pi√π mesta&quot; from ''[[ La Cenerentola]]''. &lt;ref name=jafm/&gt;

Musical terms &quot;allegro di bravura&quot; and &quot;con bravura&quot; indicate boldness, fire and brilliancy.&lt;ref name=jafm/&gt;

The term &quot;bravura&quot; also refers to daring performance in ballet, e.g., in reference of the ''[[pas de deux]]'' from ''[[Le Corsaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YcNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Garafola]] describes the [[Russian ballet]] school of [[Marius Petipa]] as &quot;marrying the new [[Italian ballet|Italian bravura technique]] to its more lyrical [[French ballet|French counterpart]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Ballet]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9U7tO1u6nU4C&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">[[File:Blackmidi.png|thumb|A section of Black MIDI music. Large numbers of notes are layered in close proximity to one another, meaning that a traditional musical score appears almost completely black - hence the name &quot;Black MIDI&quot;]]
'''Black MIDI''' is a music genre consisting of compositions that use MIDI files to make a song remix containing a large number of notes, typically in the thousands all the way into the millions. Originating in Asia in 2009, the exposure of Black MIDIs spread to North America and Europe around 2011. The style was well-received by journalists and musicians, praising the visuals blackers use to represent Black MIDI pieces, as well as the new, abstract sounds made with combining piano notes together.

==History==
The first ever Black MIDI has been marked to be Shirasagi Yukki @ Kuro Yuki Gohan's rendition of &quot;U.N. Owen Was Her?&quot;, the extra boss theme from the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' shooter video game series.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Reising|first=Sam|date=April 15, 2015|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-opposite-of-brain-candy-decoding-black-midi/|title=The Opposite of Brain Candy‚ÄîDecoding Black MIDI|work=[[NewMusicBox]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was uploaded to the site [[Nico Nico Douga]] in 2009, and the publicity of Black MIDI started to increase from Japan to China and Korea in the following two years.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; In its beginning years, Black MIDIs were represented visually with traditional, two-stave piano sheet music,&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; contained a number of notes only in the thousands, and were created with software such as MAMPlayer, Music Studio Producer, Singer Song Writer, and [[Timidity++]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Earp|first=Matt|date=December 30, 2013|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-15-year-old-prince-of-black-midi|title=Meet the 15-Year-Old Boy King of Black MIDI|publisher=Thump. [[Vice Media]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black MIDI community in Japan vanished quickly because, according to Jason Nguyen (owner of the channel Gingeas), the group was ‚Äúanalogous to those TV shows where there‚Äôs a mysterious founder of a civilization that is not really known throughout the course of the show.‚Äù&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; However, the popularity of Black MIDI transitioned into Europe and the United States&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;/&gt; due to a video of a composition uploaded by Kakakakaito1998 in February 2011, and shortly thereafter, blackers from around the world began pushing limits of the style by making compositions with notes increasing into the millions and using an enormous amount of colors and patterns to match the complexity of the notes.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; They also formed the sites Guide to Black MIDI and Impossible Music Wiki that introduced and set the norm of Black MIDI.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; 

The first of these tracks to reach the million-note mark was that of ‚ÄúNecrofantasia‚Äù from [[Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga]] by TheTrustedComputer.&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;/&gt; The end of the title of many Black MIDI videos display how many notes are in the piece.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newsweek&quot;/&gt; The amount of notes and file sizes that could be played back have grown with the rising amount of processing and 64-bit programs computers are able to handle,&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt;  and while Black MIDIs of Japanese video game music and [[anime]] are still common,&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;/&gt; the genre has also begun spilling into modern-day pop songs, such as &quot;[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]&quot; by [[Miley Cyrus]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; Despite this increased computer storage, there are still Black MIDI files that could cause an operating system to very much glitch and lag.&lt;ref name = &quot;PhoenixNewTimes&quot;/&gt; The Black MIDI file with the largest amount of storage, as of October 2014, is &quot;Bad Apple!! feat. nomico&quot;, with 1.1 [[terabytes]] and rumored to have 280 billion notes. Given its size, the file is unabled to be played back and recorded.&lt;ref name = &quot;PhoenixNewTimes&quot;/&gt; Requiring 32GB to run, the 109-million-note &quot;Klonoa&quot; is the largest Black MIDI playable online, also as of October 2014.&lt;ref name = &quot;PhoenixNewTimes&quot;/&gt;

English-language blackers have formed collaboration groups, such as the Black MIDI Team, where they make MIDI files and visuals for them together so they can be uploaded online sooner.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt; Blackers around the world have used software such as Synthesia, [[FL Studio]], [[SynthFont]], Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard, Piano From Above, MIDITrail, vanBasco Karaoke Player, MIDIPlayer (Java program), MAMPlayer, Music Studio Producer, Singer Song Writer, Tom's MIDI Player, TMIDI, and Timidity++ to create Black MIDIs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Newsweek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheets|first=Connor|date=November 14, 2013|url=http://www.newsweek.com/black-midi-will-overload-your-brain-and-your-computer-3261|title=Black MIDI Will Overload Your Brain ‚Äì And Your Computer|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, like Jason, record the MIDI files at a slow tempo and then speed the footage in video-editing to avoid RAM and processing issues.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;Black MIDI&quot; is derived from how there are so many notes that these types of compositions look nearly black on traditional sheet music.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rhizome&quot;/&gt; According to [[California]]-based blacker TheTrustedComputer, Black MIDI was intended as more of a remix style than an actual genre, and derived from the idea of &quot;bullet hell&quot; [[shoot 'em up]] games, which involve &quot;so many bullets at a time your eyes can't keep up.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Thump&quot;/&gt; Black MIDI has also been considered the digital equivalent, as well as a response, to composer [[Conlon Nancarrow]]'s use of the [[player piano]] which also involved experimenting with several thick notes to compose intricate pieces without hands.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rhizome&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Conner|first=Michael|date=September 23, 2013|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/sep/23/impossible-music-black-midi/|title=The Impossible Music of Black MIDI|publisher=Rhizome|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;PhoenixNewTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Troy|date=October 2, 2014|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/what-is-black-midi-and-what-does-it-want-with-your-soul-6587142|title=What is Black MIDI And What Does It Want With Your Soul?|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guide to Black MIDI, however, denies this influence: ‚ÄúWe believe that references to Conlon Nancarrow and piano rolls are too deep and black midi origins must be found in digital MIDI music world [''[[Sic]]''].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;/&gt;

'''Synthwave''', also called '''Retrowave''', is a musical style that emerged in the [[2000s in music|mid-2000s]], influenced by 1980s soundtrack music&lt;!--and (inspired by) the 80's pop culture in general--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;letoile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letoilemagazine.com/2014/04/09/we-will-rock-you-welcome-to-the-future-this-is-synthwave/ |title=We Will Rock You: Welcome To The Future.

==Style==
Musically, synthwave is heavily inspired by [[New wave music|new wave]] and the soundtracks of many 1980s films, videogames, cartoons and television shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghost&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17765-kavinsky-outrun/ |title=Kavinsky: Outrun |last=Raymer |first=Miles |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=2013-02-27 |accessdate=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdglow1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Higgins |url=http://www.nerdglow.com/stuff-you-hear/music/7-essential-synthwave-artists/ |title=The 7 Most Essential Synthwave Artists |publisher=Nerdglow.com |date=2014-07-29 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composers such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Vangelis]], and [[Tangerine Dream]] are frequently cited as influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;letoile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McCasker |first=Toby |url=https://noisey.vice.com/blog/riding-the-cyber-doom-synthwave-with-perturbator |title=Riding the Cyber Doom Synthwave With Perturbator &amp;#124; NOISEY |publisher=Noisey.vice.com |date=2014-06-22 |accessdate=2015-05-19|quote=Electronic music has lost a lot of its musicality lately. It's all drops and bass lines looped for five minutes non-stop. Back in the ‚Äò80s, you had classic themes and iconic melodies. I try to take the best of ‚Äò80s music and the best of what modern electro has. The 80s were the golden age of synths too, with master composers like Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, who are huge inspirations for most of us in this genre. There‚Äôs this special imagery that comes up in your mind when you think about this decade. There's a lot of ‚Äò80s clich√© that I find to be extremely cool, like gory practical effects or over-saturated neon colours. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is mainly instrumental, and often contain 1980s clich√© elements in the sound such as [[electronic drums]], [[gated reverb]], [[analog synthesizer]] bass lines and leads, all to resemble tracks from that time period. However, synthwave incorporates modern production techniques such as [[dynamic range compression#Side-chaining|sidechained]] compression and placing the bassline and kick drum prominently in the mix as heard in modern electronic music genres such as [[electro house]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vice&quot; /&gt;

Aesthetically, synthwave gives a [[retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] perspective, emulating 1980s [[science fiction]], [[action film|action]], and [[horror film|horror]] media, sometimes compared to [[cyberpunk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scenepointblank.com/reviews/perturbator/dangerous-days/ |title=Perturbator - DANGEROUS DAYS |publisher=Scene Point Blank |date=2014-12-01 |accessdate=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthwave expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calvert|first1=John|title=Xeno and Oaklander - Sets &amp; Lights|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16582/reviews/4143768|publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]]|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this aesthetic may be viewed in films and video games such as ''[[Kung Fury]]'', ''[[Turbo Kid]]'', ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdglow1&quot; /&gt; ''[[Hotline Miami]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haulica|first1=Radu|title=Power Drive 2000 Is an '80s Inspired Arcade Racer with a Great Soundtrack|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Power-Drive-2000-Is-an-80s-Inspired-Arcade-Racer-with-a-Great-Soundtrack-480474.shtml|publisher=Softpedia|date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inverno|first1=Julien|title=Perturbator et Hotline miami : du sang sur le beat|url=http://fr.ign.com/hotline-miami-2-pc/4613/feature/perturbator-et-hotline-miami-du-sang-sur-le-beat|publisher=IGN France|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roche|first1=Antoine|title=Power Drive 2000 : un KickStarter pour un jeu de course bourr√© de nostalgie|url=http://www.begeek.fr/power-drive-2000-un-kickstarter-pour-un-jeu-de-course-bourre-de-nostalgie-170159|website=begeek.fr|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discipline Reviews: Power Glove - Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (2013)|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/326.868371-Discipline-Reviews-Power-Glove-Far-Cry-3-Blood-Dragon-2013|website=EscapistMagazine.com|publisher=The Escapist Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During the second half of the 2000s there was a desire among several artists to revive the sounds of the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly New Wave and synthpop. During this period, several independent record labels emerged where the main focus was releasing artists in [[Retro style|retroesque]] genres similar to synthwave, such as [[Telefuture Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telefuturenow.com/ |title=Telefuture - Releases |publisher=Telefuturenow.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rossocorsarecords.com/ |title=Rosso Corsa &amp;#124; Music Cars Fashion Lifestyle |publisher=Rossocorsarecords.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurecityrecords.com/ |title=Future City Records |publisher=Futurecityrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Moog |url=http://future80srecords.com/ |title=Future 80's Records &amp;#124; The True Sound Of The Future |publisher=Future80srecords.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}

French acts including [[David Grellier]]'s project [[College (musical project)|College]], his collaborative project [[Valerie Collective]], [[Kavinsky]], [[Lifelike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.killahbeez.com/2009/02/06/lifelike-interview-killahbeez-exclusive/ |title=Lifelike Interview: Killahbeez Exclusive |publisher=Killahbeez.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anoraak]] are recognized as the pioneers contributing to the early synthwave sound. These early artists began creating music inspired by famous 1980s score composers, which at the time was largely associated with [[French house]].&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2015/07/the-nostalgic-allure-of-synthwave/ | title=The Nostalgic Allure of 'Synthwave' | last=Neuman | first=Julia | work=[[New York Observer]] | date=July 30, 2015 | accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anoraak later stated in a 2014 interview: &quot;American pop culture is definitely my background as a kid.

The release of the movie ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' in 2011, whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, helped drive new fans and artists inspired by it toward the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric James Lyman |url=http://www.ericlyman.net/synthwave |title=Eric James Lyman - Synthwave |publisher=Ericlyman.net |date=2015-01-11 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/user/p3_sverigesradio/playlist/0dd189NU4vbnVZpEnyBQ4q%7ctitle=Spotify%7cwork=spotify.com|title=Spotify|work=spotify.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the various influxes of new artists into the genre, several of these artists gravitated toward specific aspects of synthwave carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide variation in styles between artists who are associated with the genre. The darker sound from Kavinsky has been carried on by artists such as [[Power Glove (band)|Power Glove]],&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.game-ost.com/articles.php?id=488&amp;action=view |title=Power Glove Interview: Reviving the 80s (July 2013) |publisher=Game-ost.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perturbator]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vice&quot; /&gt; and [[Waveshaper (musician)|Waveshaper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchshuffle.com/2015/03/31/interview-wwaveshaper/|title=Interview w/Waveshaper|work=The French Shuffle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more relaxing sound brought by College, Lifelike and Anoraak is continued by artists such as [[Futurecop!]],&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discounchained.blogspot.se/2014/07/saturday-sit-down-with-futurecop.html |title=Disco Unchained: Saturday Sit-down with Futurecop! |publisher=Discounchained.blogspot.se |date=2014-07-05 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Parker (Music Producer)|Robert Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/robertparkerofficial|title=Music - Robert Parker|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdglow1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caliandro|first1=Christian|title=Dreamwave, synthwave, new retro wave.

[[Alex Westaway]] and [[Dan Haigh]] of the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Fightstar]] started a synthwave side project, [[Gunship (band)|Gunship]], whose self-titled debut album was released on July 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortitudemagazine.co.uk/music/music-interviews/interview-fightstar-going-write-new-material/23610/ Interview: Fightstar ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to write new material‚Äù], ''fortitudemagazine.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--ANY ADDITIONS REQUIRE A WIKI-ARTICLE
if there's notability and some reporting on the artist then create a wiki-article (you might create a new post on the talk page so that other people help you out)
and if that's not the case you need to wait with adding the band/musician.--&gt;

'''Folk rhythm''' is a musical genre or style with roots in American [[folk music]] and [[rhythm and blues]].  It follows in the tradition of singer/songwriters like [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] but sounds uniquely contemporary.  

Literally, the term '''folk rhythm''' refers to the genre's roots in [[American culture]] and the [[oral tradition]], (hence, folk) and the [[strum]] of guitar strings (rather than [[fingerpicking]]), as in [[rhythm guitar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14762">'''Exploito''' is a term generally given to describe cover version or sound-alike recordings that capitalize on the official recordings of artists. Typically they are of the [[Budget album|budget release]] type of album. Often the buying public would think they are buying an album by the actual artist.

==Background==
The typical exploito album is aimed at the unsuspecting buyer with the attraction of a budget price. In the United States Alshire was one label that released this type of album. In [[Toronto, Canada]], the label there was [[Arc Records (Canada)|Arc]]. The current hits of the day would be recorded. Sometimes local musicians would be used. Also some extra original compositions would be added by hired writers or people that worked for the label.&lt;ref&gt;Canehdian.com [http://www.canehdian.com/artist-directory/canadian-music-artists/blues-train-biography/ Blues Train Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
One example of how an exploito album imitates a genuine  release is the ''[[Mark, Don &amp; Terry 1966‚Äì67|Mark, Don &amp; Terry]]'' album which has the layout and cover art and design copies a recent release of a legitimate album.&lt;ref&gt;Ithsmus April 22, 2012 [http://isthmus.com/music/vinyl-cave/vinyl-cave-monumental-funk-by-mark-farner-and-don-brewer/ Vinyl Cave: &quot;Monumental Funk&quot; by Mark Farner and Don Brewer by Bob Koch]&lt;/ref&gt; They often ended up being put into stores by [[Rack Jobber]]s. Some of the releases are by unknown or no-name artists and the sound quality and packaging in the early days made for an inferior product.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' May 24, 1969 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA30&amp;lpg=RA1-PA30&amp;dq=%22Rack+Jobbers%22Budget+records&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-9Fsg45dWV&amp;sig=y9vruBc4MUiIyoYK7XJny-3s0is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW7vHGkqvKAhUHl5QKHVSeBQwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rack%20Jobbers%22Budget%20records&amp;f=false C-34 ''Rack Jobbers Force Budget Line Sales'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to almost a subgenre that is referred to as semi-exploito or exploito psychedelic rock.&lt;ref&gt;Ithsmus May 22, 2011 [http://isthmus.com/music/vinyl-cave/vinyl-cave-minnie-riperton-and-yma-sumac-rock-out/ Vinyl Cave: Minnie Riperton and Yma Sumac rock out by Bob Koch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FuzzyWasabi Wednesday, April 29, 2009 [http://fuzzywasabi.blogspot.com/2009/04/fools-on-hill-22-fabulously-fake.html Fools On The Hill 22: Fabulously Fake Freakouts ‚Äì 25 wannabe psychedelic tunes from all over the world]&lt;/ref&gt; The The Animated Egg is one.&lt;ref&gt;Night of the Living Vinyl Thursday, 9 December 2010 [http://nightofthelivingvinyl.blogspot.com/2010/12/exploito-psych-1-id-and-animated-egg.html Exploito-psych #1 The Id and The Animated Egg]&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on budget label [[Alshire Records]] and on [[Somerset Records]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Animated-Egg-The-Animated-Egg/master/596095 The Animated Egg ‚Äì The Animated Egg]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others that give some info on the musicians are ''Grass, A Rock Musical'' by Sven Libaek,&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Sven-Libaek-Grass-A-Rock-Musical/release/3485333 Sven Libaek ‚Äì Grass - A Rock Musical]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producers and labels==
;Alshire
In 1969, Alshire Records released an album called ''Famous Songs of Hank Williams: A Return Trip with the Modern Sounds In Modern Rock-Acid Sound'', an album that featured musicians covering [[Hank Williams]] songs, but in the [[acid rock]] genre. &lt;ref&gt;Popsike [http://www.popsike.com/MODERN-SOUNDSHank-Williams-LP-ALSHIRE-EXPLOITO-PSYCH-NM-RockAcid-Alshire/150715606882.html MODERN SOUNDS..Hank Williams LP ALSHIRE EXPLOITO PSYCH NM- Rock-Acid Alshire]&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a combination of country-style vocals with fuzz guitar and garage rock backing. All Music reviewer Jason Ankeny described the release as &quot;the most absurdly conceived exploito release in the entire Alshire catalog.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;All Music [http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/famous-songs-of-hank-williams-in-modern-rock-acid-sound-mr0001736884 Various Artists ''Famous Songs of Hank Williams in Modern Rock-Acid Sound (LP - Alshire #5136)'' Review by Jason Ankeny]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Crown, Custom
One label that is well known for exploito and budget albums is [[Crown Records]]. Two collectable exploito albums released on the label are The Firebirds ''Light My Fire'' album&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/artist/1535906-The-Firebirds-2 The Firebirds (2) Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; and 31 Flavors ''Hair'' album&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/artist/1535912-31-Flavors 31 Flavors Discography]&lt;/ref&gt; which were both rereleased together on a CD by Gear Fab Records.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Firebirds2-31-Flavors-Light-My-Fire-Hair/release/4990686 The Firebirds (2), 31 Flavors ‚Äì Light My Fire/ Hair]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown's subsidiary Custom put out an album ''More Psychedelic Guitars'' which featured the tracks &quot;Another Trip&quot;, &quot;Really Got It Bad&quot;, &quot;Out Of Touch&quot;, The Letdown&quot;, Psychedelic A-Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Flower Power&quot;, Can You Dig It&quot;, &quot;Sit- In&quot;, &quot;Lost In Space&quot; and &quot;Psychedelic Venture&quot;. The artist playing on the album was guitarist [[Jerry Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;Both Sides Now Publications [http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/custom.html ''Custom Album Discography By David Edwards and Mike Callahan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Cole-More-Psychedellic-Guitars/release/2629040 Jerry Cole  ‚Äì More Psychedellic Guitars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown and Custom were owned by the [[Bihari Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' Billboard 16 Dec, 1967 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xScEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Bihari+Brothers%22Crown+Custom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvUMLcrayz&amp;sig=HbwYoyUhLTxrUojyTqBW4u1Dyjs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIqufKkKvKAhUBJZQKHZ1WDAMQ6AEIRzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bihari%20Brothers%22Crown%20Custom&amp;f=false Page 6 Crown/Kent Buzzes As Custom Presser]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Sides Now Publications [http://www.bsnpubs.com/modern/crown/crownstory.html The Crown Records Story By Mike Callahan, David Edwards, Patrice Eyries, Randy Watts and Tim Neely]&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Leo Muller (producer)|Leo Muller]] &amp; [[Stereo Gold Award]]
One of the producers that has become well known for exploito records is Leo Muller which in fact was an alias for [[Dave Miller (producer)|Dave Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third series'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MD8hAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=%22Leo+Muller%22Dave+Miller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i9vzSimqHi&amp;sig=qQd-QAekulnmTwhQ4r-s1iwvcmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisr7r59qrKAhWCHJQKHQxLArcQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Leo%20Muller%22Dave%20Miller&amp;f=false Page 254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he hired [[Thin Lizzy]] musicians [[Phil Lynott]], [[Eric Bell]] and [[Brian Downey (drummer)|Brian Downey]] to record an album that would be released as '''''Funky Junction''' Play A Tribute to '''Deep Purple'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Willards Wormholes [http://www.willardswormholes.com/archives/20668 FUNKY JUNCTION Play A Tribute To Deep Purple (1973) ‚Äì Early THIN LIZZY Mercenary Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Funky Junction would be used again by Muller for the misleadingly titled ''Especially For You‚Ä¶Gladys Knight and The Pips'' with guests Funky Junction, released in 1973. The album didn't feature [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]]. It featured covers of Gladys Knight songs and two numbers credited to Funky Junction, &quot;Talking Trash&quot; and &quot;Roads End&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spiral-2 [https://nlgbbbblth.wordpress.com/tag/leo-muller/ LP 285: Unknown / Funky Junction ‚Äì Especially For You‚Ä¶Gladys Knight and The Pips (Stereo Gold Award, 1975)]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Talking Trash&quot; also appeared on ''Tamla Hits'' by Dianne And The New Worlds, a album supposedly in the [[Soul Music|Soul]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Dianne-And-The-New-Worlds-Tamla-Hits/master/358548 Dianne And The New Worlds ‚Äì Tamla Hits]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Roads End&quot; would appear on two [[Jimi Hendrix]] exploitation albums, ''Tribute To Jimi Hendrix'' by Jeff Cooper And The Stoned Wings, and ''Tribute To Jimi Hendrix'' by The Purple Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Jeff-Cooper-And-The-Stoned-Wings-Tribute-To-Jimi-Hendrix/release/840505 Jeff Cooper And The Stoned Wings ‚Äì Tribute To Jimi Hendrix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Purple-Fox-Tribute-To-Jimi-Hendrix/release/3392689 The Purple Fox  ‚Äì Tribute To Jimi Hendrix]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Deacon Records|Deacon]]
Deacon was another budget label that was sold via supermarkets and gas stations. A good deal of its catalogue consisted of orchestral and middle of the road type albums.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' October 24, 1970 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=Deacon+records+Syad+Ali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K8vB_sZQqk&amp;sig=63cgc8jueQJLNiANZAeF_KQwSNk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEwIrkzLLKAhWkGKYKHc_cBmEQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Deacon%20records%20Syad%20Ali&amp;f=false Page 62 International Music Reports, Crown, Premier, Budget Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; The label released an album in 1970 called ''The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams''. The credited artist Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners was displayed on the front cover positioned in the song list column in much smaller writing than the subject that was [[Hank Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Tex-Williams-The-Sundowners-The-Golden-Hits-From-The-Legend-That-Was-Hank-Williams/release/7121766 Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners  ‚Äì The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://cdn.discogs.com/Wjr1RNQaacXefKihzNGTtoLjM3U=/fit-in/600x595/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(96)/discogs-images/R-7121766-1445433306-8223.jpeg.jpg More Images]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 the label issued ''Tribute To Johnny Cash''. Like the ''Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams'' release, the credited artist had one part of the name the same as the subject artist.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Johnny-Dodds-Tribute-To-Johnny-Cash/release/6246619 Johnny Dodds (2)  ‚Äì Tribute To Johnny Cash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Tex-Williams-The-Sundowners-The-Golden-Hits-From-The-Legend-That-Was-Hank-Williams/release/7121766 Tex Williams &amp; The Sundowners  ‚Äì The Golden Hits From The Legend That Was Hank Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; The label even issued a single-sided 45RPM single aimed at bingo halls with the songs &quot;Let's Play Bingo&quot; and &quot;Bingo Goes Pop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;45 Sleeves [http://45-sleeves.com/UK/deacon/deac-uk.htm DEACON, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Sutton Records|Sutton]]
Sutton was founded in 1963 by [[Bob Blythe]], formerly of [[Tops Records]],&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' Mar 2, 1963 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dwsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Sutton+Records%22Budget&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgJETTcq5F&amp;sig=7sjOj9jtKYXKGIc6s3n2bIe7Yz0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN0dKIqI_KAhVGI6YKHWjRDKAQ6AEINTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sutton%20Records%22Budget&amp;f=false Page 6 Bob Blythe Starts New Name Talent Low-Budget LP Line]&lt;/ref&gt; was a label known for budget exploito albums. One band that had records released under its own name but destined straight for the cut out bins to be filled by the rack jobbers was the New Dimension. Surf music producers [[Tony Hilder]] and [[Bob Hafner]] provided the material.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond The Beat Generation [http://home.unet.nl/kesteloo/newdimensions.html The New Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MusicDish e-Journal 2001-05-14 [http://www.musicdish.com/mag/index.php3?id=3760 From Surf to Folk Rock: He's Done it All! ''An Interview with SoCal's Craig Nuttycombe'' By Mike Dugo, 60sGarageBands]&lt;/ref&gt; One album to meet this fate was ''Soul with The New Dimensions'', released on Sutton SSU 336.&lt;ref&gt;Popsike [http://www.popsike.com/The-New-Dimensions-LP-Soul-garage-surf-tittyshaker/180689145914.html The New Dimensions LP Soul garage surf tittyshaker]&lt;/ref&gt; Another one by the same group was Surf'n Bongos that years later would end up be auctioned under the heading of THE New Dimensions Surf'n Bongos ~ Fuzz Garage Surf Exploito 1963 Sutton LP.&lt;ref&gt;Worthpoint [http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/dimensions-surf-bongos-fuzz-garage-291341819 THE NEW DIMENSIONS SURF 'N BONGOS ~ FUZZ GARAGE SURF EXPLOITO 1963 SUTTON LP]&lt;/ref&gt; As announced by ''Billboard'' in 1965, [[Pat Collins (hypnotist)|Pat Collins]] aka the &quot;Hip Hypnotist&quot; was to do a couple of albums for the label.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'' October 16, 1965 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Sutton+Records%22Billboard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2pEhcQGIDA&amp;sig=0S5zTKIsrHu-LXrlFRWNR9FQ9VE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5uunzwY_KAhWG2KYKHSfYCZUQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sutton%20Records%22Billboard&amp;f=false Page 16 Signings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploitation==

===Behavior and pastimes===
One album that capitalized on human behavior was ''Music To Strip For Your Man'' by Teddy Phillips And His Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/Teddy-Phillips-And-His-Orchestra-Music-To-Strip-For-Your-Man-By/release/2042671 Teddy Phillips And His Orchestra ‚Äì Music To Strip For Your Man By]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Sutton Records|Sutton]] released the ''Surf 'n Bongos'' album by the New Dimensions. The cover featured swimsuit clad girls with shirtless surfing boys at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;Popsike [http://www.popsike.com/THE-NEW-DIMENSIONS-Surf-n-Bongos-fuzz-garage-surf-exploito-1963-SUTTON-LP/230770548100.html THE NEW DIMENSIONS Surf 'n Bongos ~ fuzz garage surf exploito 1963 SUTTON LP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surfadelic November 13, 2014 [https://surfadelic2.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/the-new-dimensions-surfn-bongos-1963/ THE NEW DIMENSIONS ‚Äì Surf‚ÄôN Bongos (1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television shows===
In 1966, a record label called Tifton released an album called ''Batman And Robin'' by The Sensational Guitars Of Dan &amp; Dale. The guitars were actually by [[Danny Kalb]] and [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]]. [[Sun Ra]] and [[Al Kooper]] played organ.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs [http://www.discogs.com/The-Sensational-Guitars-Of-Dan-Dale-Batman-And-Robin/release/395760 The Sensational Guitars Of Dan &amp; Dale ‚Äì Batman And Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
Some exploito albums have been of better-than-average quality with their musical arrangements. One example is the ''Mariano and the Unbelievables'' album that was released in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed'' Edited by Kim Cooper and David Smay, Illustrations by David Neely [https://books.google.com/books?id=jFKsR0K82hYC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=Exploito+music&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilnKTh66rKAhWEJ6YKHb8YAz8Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Exploito%20music&amp;f=false ''Mariano and the Unbelievaables'' (Capiltol, 1967)]&lt;/ref&gt; An album by a group called ''The Blues Train'' that was released in 1970 on a budget exploit label called Condor is now valued by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Canehdian.com [http://www.canehdian.com/artist-directory/canadian-music-artists/blues-train-biography/ Blues Train Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of [[written music]], although since the beginning of the [[recording industry]], it is also disseminated through [[sound recording|recordings]]. Traditional music forms such as early [[blues]] songs or [[hymn]]s were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; 

The original application of the term is to music of the 1880s [[Tin Pan Alley]] period in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Although popular music sometimes is known as &quot;pop music&quot;, the two terms are not interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm|title = Pop Music Defined|date = |accessdate = 13 November 2015|website = About Entertainment|publisher = About.com|last = Lamb|first = Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Robert. &quot;Popular music&quot;. ''Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[pop music]] usually refers to a specific musical genre ''within'' popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Timothy (2014). &quot;Music Genre As Method&quot;. ''Cultural Studies Review.'' 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable [[melody|melodies]]. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and chorus or [[refrain]] repeating throughout the song and the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; 

In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Lashua|first = Brett|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283115|location = Basingstoke|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies: An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 9780203862094|location = London|pages = 237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western popular music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

== Definition ==
Scholars have classified music as &quot;popular&quot; based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with [[classical music]], in which many musicians learn pieces from [[sheet music]]); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace [[commodity]] in a [[capitalist]] context, and other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grove Music Online|last = Middleton|first = Peter|publisher = Oxford Index|year = 2001|isbn = 9781561592630|location = |pages = |last2 = Manuel|chapter = Popular Music|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience ([[mass appeal]]) or whether audience is of a certain [[social class]] is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt;  Moreover, &quot;understandings of popular music have changed with time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studying Popular Music|last = Middleton|first = Richard|publisher = Open University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0335152759|location = Philadelphia|pages = 46, 136, 155, 249, 293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; &quot;popular as [[Populism|populist]],&quot; or having overtones of liberation and expression; &quot;popular as [[Folk music|folk]],&quot; or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; &quot;popular as [[counterculture]],&quot; or empowering citizens to act against the [[oppression]] they face; and &quot;popular as mass,&quot; or the music becomes the tool for [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Accessibility of Music: Participation, Reception and Contact.|last = Eisentraut|first = Jochen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9781139616294|location = Cambridge|pages = 41‚Äì42, 197‚Äì198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Popular music and school music education: Chinese students‚Äô preferences and dilemmas in Shanghai, China|url = http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/33/3/304|journal = International Journal of Music Education|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 0255-7614|pages = 304‚Äì324|volume = 33|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0255761415569115|first = Wing-Wah|last = Law|first2 = Wai-Chung|last2 = Ho}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a [[subculture]]. The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;

==Form of Western popular music==
{{Main|Song structure}}

Form in popular music is most often [[sectional form|sectional]], the most common sections being [[Song structure#Verse|verse]], chorus or refrain, and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Other common [[musical form|forms]] include [[thirty-two-bar form]], [[chorus form]] *(Middleton pg 30), and [[twelve-bar blues]]. Popular music songs are rarely composed using different music for each stanza of the lyrics (songs composed in this fashion are said to be &quot;[[through-composed]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The verse and chorus are considered the primary elements. Each verse usually has the same melody (possibly with some slight modifications), but the lyrics change for most verses. The chorus (or &quot;refrain&quot;) usually has a melodic phrase and a key lyrical line which is repeated. Pop songs may have an [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]] (&quot;tag&quot;), but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs that use verses and choruses often have a bridge, which, as its name suggests, is a section which connects the verse and chorus at one or more points in the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

The verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the bridge, intro, and coda (also called an &quot;outro&quot;) tend to be used only once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues- or jazz-influenced pop, the solo may be improvised based on the chord progression. A solo usually features a single instrumental performer (e.g., a guitarist or a harmonica player) or less commonly, more than one instrumentalist (e.g., a trumpeter and a sax player).&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

Thirty-two-bar form uses four sections, most often eight measures long each (4√ó8=32), two verses or A sections, a contrasting B section (the bridge or &quot;middle-eight&quot;) and a return of the verse in one last A section (AABA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studying Popular Music|last = Middleton|first = Richard|publisher = Open University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0335152759|location = Philadelphia|pages = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verse-chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form, in compound AABA forms. Variations such as a1 and a2 can also be used. The repetition of one chord progression may mark off the only section in a simple verse form such as the twelve bar blues.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|last = |first = |publisher = Grove|year = 2001|isbn = 0333608003|location = New York|pages = 142‚Äì144|editor-last = Sadie|editor-first = Stanley|chapter = Popular Music: Form|volume = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development in North America and Europe==
[[Image:Jenny Lind in La Sonnambula.jpg|thumb|The 19th century singer [[Jenny Lind]] depicted performing ''[[La sonnambula]]'']]
&quot;The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of [[sheet music]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;Middleton, Richard and Peter Manuel. &quot;Popular music&quot; in ''Grove Music Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur, middle-class music-makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. Amateur music-making in the 19th century often centred around the [[piano]], as this instrument could play [[melody|melodies]], chords and basslines, thus enabling a pianist to reproduce popular songs and pieces. In addition to the influence of sheet music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular music performances in &quot;pleasure gardens and [[dance halls]], popular theatres and concert rooms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; The early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] opera singer [[Jenny Lind]], who toured the US in the mid-19th century. In addition to living room amateur music-making during the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music during this era by participating in amateur choirs, joining [[brass bands]] or playing in amateur orchestras.

The centre of the music publishing industry in the US during the late 19th century was in New York's '[[Tin Pan Alley]]' district. The Tin Pan Alley music publishers developed a new method for promoting sheet music: incessant promotion of new songs. One of the technological innovations that helped to spread popular music around the turn of the century was [[player pianos]]. A player piano could be used to record a skilled pianist's rendition of a piano piece. This recorded performance could be &quot;played back&quot; on another player piano. This allowed a larger number of music lovers to hear the new popular piano tunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; By the early 1900s, the big trends in popular music were the increasing popularity of vaudeville theaters and dance halls and a new invention‚Äîthe [[gramophone player]]. The record industry grew very rapidly; &quot;By 1920 there were almost 80 record companies in Britain, and almost 200 in the USA&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; The availability of records enabled a larger percentage of the population to hear the top singers and bands.

Radio broadcasting of music, which began in the early 1920s, helped to spread popular songs to a huge audience, enabling a much larger proportion of the population to hear songs performed by professional singers and music ensembles, including individuals from lower income groups who previously would not have been able to afford concert tickets. Radio broadcasting increased the ability of songwriters, singers and bandleaders to become nationally known. Another factor which helped to disseminate popular music was the introduction of &quot;talking pictures&quot;‚Äî[[sound films]]‚Äîin the late 1920s, which also included music and songs. In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, there was a move towards consolidation in the recording industry, which led several major companies to dominate the record industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, the new invention of television began to play an increasingly important role in disseminating new popular music. Variety shows regularly showcased popular singers and bands. In the 1960s, the development of new technologies in recording, such as multitrack recorders gave [[sound engineer]]s and [[record producer]]s an increasingly important role in popular music. By using multitrack recording techniques, sound engineers could create new sounds and [[sound effect]]s that were not possible using traditional &quot;live&quot; recording techniques,&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; such as a singer performing her own backup vocals or having a [[lead guitar]]ist play [[rhythm guitar]] behind her [[guitar solo]]. During the 1960s era of [[psychedelic music]], the recording studio was used to create even more unusual sounds, in order to mimic the effect of taking [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogenic drug]]s, some songs used tapes of instruments played backwards or panned the music from one side to the other of the stereo image.

In the 1970s, the trend towards consolidation in the recording industry continued to the point that the &quot;... dominance was in the hands of five huge transnational organizations, three American-owned ([[Warner Music Group|WEA]], [[RCA]], [[CBS Records International|CBS]]) and two European-owned [[companies]] ([[EMI]], [[Polygram]])&quot;. In the 1990s, the consolidation trend took a new turn: inter-media consolidation. This trend saw music recording companies being consolidated with film, television, magazines, and other media companies, an approach which facilitated [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] promotion between subsidiaries. For example, a record company's singing star could be cross-promoted by the conglomerate's television [[talk show]]s and magazine arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

The &quot;introduction of digital equipment (mixing desks, synthesizers, samplers, sequencers)&quot; in the 1990s resulted in what ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music]]'' dubbed the creation of &quot;new sound worlds&quot;, as well as facilitating DIY music production by amateur musicians and &quot;tiny independent [[record labels]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; In the 1990s, the availability of sound recording software and [[effects unit]]s software meant that an amateur indie band could record an album‚Äîwhich required a fully equipped recording studio in previous decades‚Äîusing little more than a [[laptop]] and a good quality [[microphone]].

== Global perspective ==
In contrast to Western popular music, a genre of music that is popular outside of a Western nation, is categorized into [[World music]]. This label turns otherwise popular styles of music into an exotic and unknown category''.'' The Western concept of 'World Music' homogenizes many different genres of popular music under one accessible term for Western audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; New media technology has led urban music styles to filter into distant rural areas across the globe. The rural areas, in turn, are able to give feedback to the urban centers about the new styles of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; Urbanization, modernization, exposure to foreign music and mass media have contributed to hybrid urban pop styles. The hybrid styles have also found a space within Western popular music through the expressions of their national culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; Recipient cultures borrow elements from host cultures and alter the meaning and context found in the host culture. Many Western styles, in turn, have become international styles through multinational recording studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt;

=== Africa ===

{{See also|African popular music}}
[[File:Didier Awadi.jpg|thumb|Senegalese rapper, [[Didier Awadi]]]]

Popular African music styles have stemmed from traditional entertainment genres, rather than evolving from music used with certain  traditional ceremonies like weddings, births, or funerals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries, African-American and Afro-Latin music, and region-specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; The genre of music, [[Maskanda]], is popular in its culture of origin, South Africa. Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition, the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; A popular maskandi artist, Phuzekhemisi, had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere. His music producer, West Nikosi, was looking for the commercial success in Phuzekhemisi's music rather than starting a political controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music and Social Change in South Africa: Maskanda Past and Present|last = Olsen|first = Kathryn|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781439911389|location = Phildephia|pages = 61‚Äì62, 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political songs have been an important category of African popular music in many societies. During the continent's struggle against colonial rule, nationalistic songs boosted citizens' morale. These songs were based on Western marches and hymns reflecting the European education system that the early nationalistic leaders grew up in. Not all African political songs were based on Western styles. For example, in South Africa, the political songs during the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were based on traditional tribal styles along with hybrid forms of imported genres.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; Activists used protest and freedom songs to persuade individuals to take action, become educated with the struggle, and empower others to be politically conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds of Resistance: The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism|last = Rojas|first = Eunice|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2013|isbn = 9780313398063|location = Santa Barbara|pages = 266‚Äì267}}&lt;/ref&gt; These songs reflected the nuances between the different classes involved in the liberation struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt;

One of the genres people of Africa use for political expression is [[Hip hop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Saucier|first = Paul Khalil|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283108|location = Basingstoke|pages = 196‚Äì197, 199, 201, 203‚Äì204, 206|chapter = Continental Drift: The Politics and Poetics of African Hip Hop|editor-last = Lashua|editor-first = Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hip hop in Africa is based on the North American template, it has been remade to produce new meanings for African young people. This allows the genre to be both locally and globally influential.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; African youth are shaped by the fast-growing genre's ability to communicate, educate, empower, and entertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; Artists who would have started in traditional music genres, like maskanda, became hip hop artists to provide a stronger career path for themselves. These rappers compare themselves to the traditional artists like the [[griot]] and oral storyteller, who both had a role in reflecting on the internal dynamics of the larger society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; African hip hop creates youth culture, community intelligence, and global solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt;

Popular music in Indonesia can be categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that are originated in Indonesia and indigenous in style.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; The genre of music, [[Dangdut]], is a genre of popular music specifically found in [[Indonesia]]. Dangdut formed two other styles of popular music, [[Indo pop|Indo-pop]] and [[Underground music|Underground]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Wallach|first = Jeremy|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283108|location = Basingstoke|pages = 149, 151‚Äì152, 157|editor-last = Lashua|editor-first = Brett|chapter = Indieglobalization and the Triumph of Punk in Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; together to create a new hybrid or fusion genre. The genre takes the noisy instrumentation from Underground, but still makes it easy to listen to like Indo-pop. Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock, pop, and traditional music to create this new sound that lines up with the consumers' tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History, Modernity, and Music Genre in Indonesia: Popular Music Genres in the Dutch East Indies and Following Independence|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/asian_music/v044/44.2.wallach01.html|journal = Asian Music|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1553-5630|pages = 3‚Äì23|volume = 44|issue = 2|doi = 10.1353/amu.2013.0020|first = Jeremy|last = Wallach|first2 = Esther|last2 = Clinton}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing, youth culture, the resurgence of Islam, and the capitalist entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Popular Musics of the Non-Western World|last = Manuel|first = Peter|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1988|isbn = 0195053427|location = New York|pages = 7, 11‚Äì12, 20, 85‚Äì86, 88, 205, 210, 212, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another music scene that is popular in Indonesia is [[Punk rock]]. This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; Jeremy Wallach argues that while [[Green Day]] was seen as the &quot;death of punk,&quot; in Indonesia they were the catalyst for a larger punk movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; Punk in Indonesia calls on the English-speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk culture and become open-minded to the transnational genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;

==== China ====

In a study involving young students in [[Shanghai]], youth find that they enjoy to listen to both Chinese, other Asian nationalities, and Anglo-American popular music. There are three ways that young people of [[China]] were able to access global music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; The first reason was a policy change since the late 1970s where the country was opened up to the rest of the world instead of being self-contained. This created more opportunities for Chinese people to interact with people outside of their country of origin to create a more globalized culture. The second reason is that the Chinese television and music industry since the 1980s has broadcast television shows from their neighboring Asian societies and the West. The third reason is the impact of the internet and smart phones on the accessibility of streaming music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; Students in China make up 30.2% of China's internet population and the third and fifth most popular uses of the internet are respectively, internet music and internet video use. The youth described as being able to connect to the emotions and language of the Chinese music, but also enjoyed the melodies found within Anglo-American music. The students also believed that listening to the English music would improve their English language skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;/&gt;''

====Middle East====
[[File:KioskSF.JPG|thumb|KioskSF|Iranian rock band [[Kiosk]], live in 2007]]
Modernization of music in the Arab world involved borrowing inspiration from Turkish music and Western musical styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Popular Musics of the Non-Western World|last = Danielson|first = Virginia|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1988|isbn = 0195053427|location = New York|pages = 151, 156‚Äì158|editor-last = Manuel|editor-first = Peter Lamarche|chapter = The Arab Middle East}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Egyptian singer, [[Umm Kulthum]], stated,&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We must respect ourselves and our art. The Indians have set a good example for us - they show great respect for themselves and their arts. Wherever they are, they wear their native dress and their music is known throughout the world. This is the right way.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;She discussed this to explain why Egypt and the Arab world needed to take pride in the popular music styles originating in their culture so the styles were not lost in the modernization.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt; Local musicians learned Western instrumental styles to create their own popular styles including their native languages and indigenous musical features.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt; Communities in throughout the Arab world place high value on their indigenous musical identities while assimilating to new musical styles from neighboring countries or mass media.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, popular music has been seen as a problem for the [[Iran]]ian government because of the non-religious meanings within the music and the bodily movements of dancing or headbanging.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Underground, overground: Rock music and youth discourses in Iran|url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00210860500300820|journal = Iranian Studies|date = 2005-09-01|issn = 0021-0862|pages = 463‚Äì494|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/00210860500300820|first = Laudan|last = Nooshin}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, [[Heavy metal music|metal]] became a popular underground subculture through the [[Middle East]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11097">'''Epic Music''' (epic ‚â† adjective) is a [[21st-century classical music|modern classical]]-like [[Music genre|musical genre]] derived from a wide array of genres.

== History ==
The first official [[trailer music]] companies which later became Epic Music producers were created in the 1990s, with [[Immediate Music]] being one of the first starting as early as 1993. From then until the 2010s a lot of albums and single tracks were created, however they were only available to the companies‚Äô clients and the [[film industry]]. Until this day only few of these albums have been officially, or unofficially through [[Social media|Internet platforms]], released to the public. It was around 2005-2010 some composers started to pick up public fame for the first time, thanks to their songs being featured at special events like the Olympic Games and the many trailers they composed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/08/entertainment/la-ca-movie-trailer-music-20120408|title=Their movie trailer music is proudly commercial|last=Rome|first=Emily|date=April 8, 2012|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was officially named Epic Music by its community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/musician-tips/film-trailer-music-pt-2-an-interview-with-two-steps-from-hell/|title=Film Trailer Music, Pt. 2: An Interview with Two Steps from Hell|last=Robley|first=Chris|date=July 26, 2012|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when composers finally started releasing public albums. The first company to release an album of Epic Music was [[Globus (music)|Globus]] ([[Epicon (album)|Epicon]]), followed by Immediate Music with [[Trailerhead]] in 2008 and later in the same series with [[Trailerhead: Nu Epiq|Nu Epiq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trailermusicnews.com/2014/07/nu-epiq-interview-yoav-goren/|title=Nu Epiq: Interview with Immediate Music‚Äôs President Yoav Goren|last=Lebrun|first=Clothilde|date=July 19, 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/movie-trailers-and-epic-music-genre/|title=Coming Soon: The 'Epic Music' of Movie Trailers|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/epic-music-pioneers-immediate-release-genre-defining-new-album-trailerhead-nu-epiq-259048601.html|title='Epic Muisc' Pioneers IMMEDIATE Releasee genre Defining new Album Trailerhead: NU EPIQ|last=O'Connor-Read|first=Greg|date=May 13, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and many requests from fans encouraged [[Two Steps from Hell]] to release their first public album [[Invincible (Two Steps from Hell album)|Invincible]] and things just keep growing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gearpatrol.com/2016/05/06/thomas-bergersen-composer-interview/|title=Meet Thomas Bergersen ‚Äî Master of Powerful, Epic Music|last=Wright|first=Chris|date=May 6, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from there. These companies/composers showed that publicizing music which was first vaguely referred to as [[Trailer music|Trailer]] and [[Film score|Film music]] worked and that there was an audience for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2013/01/wecreatemusic/otc-two-steps-from-hell.aspx|title=On the Charts: Two Steps from Hell|last=Rosenbloom|first=Etan|date=January 24, 2013|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/trailermusiclive/posts/716448525042800|title=Trailer-Musik auch als Live-Event - Check Comment section|last=|first=|date=March 10, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more albums being released publicly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/05/prweb11823506.htm|title=The Music That Sells Hollywood‚Äôs Top Blockbusters: audiomachine|last=Helwig|first=David|date=May 6, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=105461&amp;string=X-Ray|title=Imperativa Records To Release First Ever Best Of 'Epic Music' Genre Compilation Album &quot;This Is Epic Music: Volume 1&quot;|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the community grew and has kept growing ever since, even reaching outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/30130-astronaut-barry-butch-wilmore-for-a-beautiful-planet|title=Astronaut Barry Butch Wilmore for A Beautiful Planet|last=Barker|first=Lynn|date=April 25, 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day ===
Separating itself from the [[Trailer music|Trailer Music]] genre, Epic Music is a stand-alone genre which produces a lot of music that can be used in trailers (which then also makes it Trailer Music).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://screen-watch.com/2013/05/14/interview-with-thomas-bergersen-composer-two-steps-from-hell/|title=Interview with Thomas Bergersen {{!}} Composer, ‚ÄòTwo Steps From Hell‚Äô|date=2013-05-14|website=Screen Watch|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people who like EM also tend to like Trailer and [[Film score|Film Music]] due to the many similarities, the community distinguish the three as separate genres. EM has also proven to be similar to [[piano]] and/or [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] music.

Since EM is a growing genre a lot of new great composers have found a home in the genre over the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trailermusicnews.com/2015/05/dragons-kings-interview-composers-gothic-storms-biggest-release-date/|title=Dragons &amp; Kings: Interview with the Composers of Gothic Storm‚Äôs Biggest Release to Date|last=Lebrun|first=Clothilde|date=May 1, 2015|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But not only composers profit from making songs. Official promotion [[YouTube]] channels are booming business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/295974/young-musician-finds-grandeur-in-epic-genre.html|title=Young musician finds grandeur in epic genre|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating cinematics, mixes and promoting tracks. These channels are called EMCs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J5clzDnLNAWkBqrWXDzyYJL73w4zqT-af6pmMVnk8To/edit?usp=sharing|title=Research of EMCs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=EMSP|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Epic Music Channels).

== Categories ==
These are the most common styles used for Epic Music tracks; a track can consist of multiple styles. These categories and names are more descriptive rather than distinct classifications. 

=== Vocal ===

A track counts as vocal if there is at least one [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] in it or if vocals form a majority of the track. Any track can be vocal, from emotional to horror. An example of a vocal track is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUiWIBiVH4U Extreme Music - Bring Me Back To Life]

=== World ===

[[World music|World]] is the somewhat modern name for [[folklore]]. This style contains [[Culture|cultural]] or [[Folk music|traditional music]] like [[Celtic music|Celtic]], [[Nordic folk music|Nordic]]/Viking and Pirate. However, these styles more generally are distinct from epic. For example, [[Adrian von Ziegler]] is currently one of the most famous Celtic Music composers, but only few of his tracks are considered Epic. Relatively unknown composers of these styles may find a niche in epic, for with pieces such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWObTfiovD8 Epic Celtic Music Mix - Most Powerful &amp; Beautiful Celtic Music | Vol.1]

=== Hybrid/Rock ===

Hybrid means [[cross-genre]]. Tracks labeled hybrid are more likely to sound like [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] or any other genre related to electro-type music, but they are usually specifically made to fit in the Epic genre by implementing certain feelings/emotions. [[Rock music|Rock]] is said to sound the most like classical music out of all modern genres, which is why it fits very well in Epic Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seat42f.com/la-indie-rockers-astra-heights-release-sweeping-360-video-for-new-single-you-got-the-heart.html|title=Astra Heights teams up with Yoav Goren|last=|first=|date=February 26, 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to both styles' powerful [[arrangement]]s, hybrid and rock usually go hand in hand, like in this famous track: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqj1hf-KQ2c Les Friction - World On Fire]

=== Other (Orchestral/Choral) ===

Some Epic Music is not as easily classifiable, and they are commonly described by feelings/emotions such as Emotional, Uplifting, Powerful, Dramatic, Inspirational, Action, Adventure, Heroic or Sad. Names like Battle, Horror, Massive, Pounding, Intense, Legendary, Vengeful, Wondrous, Fantasy or Majestic are also often used to evoke a certain mood. A notable Epic Music is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASj81daun5Q Two Steps From Hell - Protectors of the Earth]

== Epic Composers ==
This is an incomplete list of Epic Scorers/Composers. Several of these major companies/composers even brand themselves as Epic Music producers - with mottos such as &quot;the home of Epic Music&quot;, &quot;where Epic Music lives&quot; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACQwe3eELFSl6i8P_YU5JO_7rBqNUL5IzfYB4WFVvUU/edit?usp=sharing|title=Most still active Epic Music Scorers|last=|first=|date=May 17, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Debuts and career ===

'''System Band'''  was formed in 1980, by Isnard Douby and Harold Joseph, former members of &quot;Les fr√®res Dejean&quot;. They surrounded themselves with musicians who became the core of the band. Since its creation, the band has became a major player of the Kompa music industry. Led by Isnard Douby, System Band has released a great number of hits, which has come to be classics of the haitian and caribbean musical repertoire.

&quot;Complainte&quot; was the first hit of System Band, written by Isnard Douby and Harold Joseph, the song was from the album &quot;Bam Pass√©&quot; in 1980.  In 1982, they released the love song &quot;Chagrin d'amour&quot;, by the same duet Douby-Harold. This year was also the beginning of the collaboration with Marc Chevalier, the band manager.

In 1983, the song &quot;Vacances&quot; made a splash and became a summer holiday hit, today synonymous of fun and amusement. &quot;Pa Pile&quot; from the same album and written by Isnard douby was the song in which System Band introduced for the first time the groove sound &quot;Kitel mach√©&quot; in the Kompa Music industry.

In 1988, System Band met the talented songwriter Michel-Ange Bazile, that meeting has impacted significantly the group's evolution. His music brought the band to the next level, with much more powerful songs, and lyrics profoundly influenced by the events affecting the haitian population, as the song &quot;Move Souvni&quot; in 1989, inspired par the death of Jean Baptiste Edouard, the keyboard player of the band. 
The tune &quot;Fiert√© nationale&quot; in 1991 is an other example of this musical evolution, as it was composed in the context of the [[Haitian general election, 1990‚Äì91|Haitian general election]], first democratic electoral process in the country. System Band's music became more personal and increasingly marked by the Haitian roots, a change highly acclaimed by the fans.

System Band has authored a large number of Kompa music hits, several band's members are the source of those tunes. 
Reginald Benjamin, the groove touch of System Band, composed many songs, like &quot;Anita&quot; in 1986, famous for this memorable guitar groove. Two years later, &quot;Ou pa kampe sou ayin&quot; by the same musician, introduce a new Kompa style. In 1992, the romantic music title &quot; Rencontre inoubliable&quot; and &quot;Moun m√©l√©&quot; in 1993 are also songs written by the lead guitarist.

The guitarist Ronald Smith, has also written many System Band hits like &quot;Bam pas√©&quot;, &quot;Innocent&quot; in1986, &quot;Dom Laj&quot; in 1993 or &quot;Ou fe'm rele&quot;. An other who has to be mentioned,  is Michel Blaise, a very versatile musician who could sing, and play drums as well as percussion or congas. He's also the songwriter of plenty of hits like &quot;Beeper&quot; from the album &quot;Kot√© ou y√© la-a&quot;, from which is also extracted the famous title &quot;AVEG&quot; written by Michel-Ange Bazile. Michel Blaise wrote the tunes Viagra and Baton Moise respectively released in 1999 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotelevisioncaraibes.com/nouvelles/culture/le_system_band_se_r_veille_de_son_long_sommeil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is quite impossible to not mention System Band without a mention of Fritz Bernard Fr√©d√©ric aka Ti Mitou, legendary singer and musician. He joined the band in 1981, et got involved in every albums of the group not only as a percussionist but also as a singer, from the 1983, year of the tune &quot;Systemania&quot; in which Ti Mitou sang the melody. He was the voice of a few hits of System Band including &quot;La Vie&quot; &quot;Ou Sou Bloff&quot;, &quot;Toujou Zanmi&quot;, composed by Lucien C√©ran, or the hit &quot;Rele Sou ko ou&quot; composed by Ernst Vincent. Est la voix de quelques hits de System Band, des titres tels que &quot;La Vie&quot;, &quot;Ou Sou Bloff&quot;; &quot;Toujou Zanmi&quot;, compos√©s par Lucien C√©ran, ou encore le morceau &quot;Rele Sou Ko Ou&quot; compos√© par Ernst Vincent (Tines). in 2001, he had to stop perform with the band for medical reasons. He dies in February 2007, an important loss for the band and for the fans.

As a Kompa music and Haitian scene major figure, System Band does not hesitate when it comes to depict Haitian society or be present during events highlighting life in Haiti. For example, the song &quot;Ou Trompe'm&quot; in 1987 which became iconic in electoral context. The title was so widely used in the country that it ended up being the symbol of Haitian people left in disappointment. In the same vein, the band also showed its support to Haitian when the country suffered from the ravages of Jeanne hurricane in 2004. It was the same in 2010, System Band was there during the tragic earthquake in Haiti, which inspired the &quot;Goudou goudou&quot; song.

On another note, other songs such as &quot;Loulou&quot; in 1988, composed by the bassist Ernst Vincent and Isnard Douby, brought a brand new word in the Haitian Creole vocabulary. Loulou is now commonly accepted as a term describing a man left by his wife who has been seduced by another man. The tune &quot;Cesar&quot; by Michel-Ange Bazile in 1990, is a different example of System Band's impact. That song introduced the word &quot;cesar&quot; as a synonym for money.

== Music and identity ==

=== Ambassador for Haitian culture ===
System Band is a core group of the Haitian musical landscape, and equally a true ambassador of this music on the international scene. They performed in Paris in 1998 and 1999, but also at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, The DeWitt Clinton Park and the Boys and Girls High School in New York.

The group shared the stage with some caribbean and international music industry's great names such as [[Kassav']] at the Ritz Theatre in 1992, or [[Mighty Sparrow]] and [[Queen Latifah]], in front of a multiethnic audience of 100 000 people. At different times and diverse setting, they also performed some different music style like soul music, Jazz, R&amp;B or latin music. System Band have equally released a couple of Soca tunes, a music style from Trinidad and Tobago.

=== Style and particularities ===

The System Band style is a modernization of the original Kompa of [[Nemours Jean Baptiste]]}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africultures.com/php/?nav=article&amp;no=377&lt;/ref&gt; This style is very distinctive and consists in the creation of a guitar groovy sound mixed with chorus sound. System Band's songs are mainly catchy and influenced by the Haitian [[Rasin]] music (Mizik Rasin or roots music, ''rasin'' means roots in Haitian Creole), and Funk Music. These melodies are accompanied by a percussions hard beat. This style, typical from the System Band, has been named &quot; Kompa Machiavel&quot;, by the group.

Beyond the musical content, the band is famous for the slogans created by the group members. Those slogans, become signatures of System Band, are actually some phrases that are either arrogant and cheeky or melancholic, sad and caring.

The band's bassist Ernst Vincent &quot;Tines&quot; has played a major regarding Kompa music transformation. He's the one who introduced bass lines, slapping and bass triplets, these modernizations had an important impact on Kompa and Haitian music.

System Band is one the Haitian band that brought the most modernization and innovation to Kompa Music industry. They received many nominations (including the Caribbean Music Award for the song &quot;Se ou'm vle&quot;) and awards, including the Appollo Award for Excellence in the Performing Arts, for what their support and their contribution to the promotion of Haitian music. They has been also rewarded with the Best Band Haitian Music Award in 1997.

[[File:Spartakiade.JPG|thumb|upright|250px|The [[Red Sport International]] defends the [[Soviet Union]]: Poster of the 2d International Spartakiad of the Red Sport International ([[Berlin]], 1931)]]
'''Spartakiade''' (or Spartakiad) was an international sports event that was sponsored by the [[Soviet Union]]. Five international Spartakiades were held from 1928 to 1937. Later Spartakiads were organized as national sport events of the Eastern bloc countries. The games were organized by [[Red Sport International]].

==Background==
{{more|Red Sport International}}
The [[Soviet Union]] attempted to use Spartakiads to both oppose and supplement the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Books/seriousfun.pdf Serious Fun: A History of Spectator Sports in the USSR]. Robert Edelman, pg 149&lt;/ref&gt; (In Russian, there is a certain parallelism in the names: &quot;Spartakiada&quot; and &quot;Olimpiada&quot;.) The name, derived from the name of the [[slavery|slave]] rebel leader, [[Spartacus]],&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd edition, volume 24 (part 1), p. 286, Moscow, Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya publisher, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; was intended to symbolize [[proletarian internationalism]] because Spartacus' revolt united slaves from diverse ethnic backgrounds within the [[Roman Empire]]. As a [[classical antiquity|Classical]] figure, Spartacus also stood directly in contrast to the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] nature of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] on which the modern &quot;capitalist&quot; Olympics were based. The first Winter Spartakiad was held in February 1928 in [[Oslo]], and the first Summer Spartakiad was held in August 1928 in [[Moscow]].

The first Spartakiads in the USSR took place in 1923 within formations of the [[Red Army]] and the Spartak Youth Physical Culture organization in [[Petrograd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet_encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0/ Spartakiad] at [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Moscow Spartakiad in 1928 was also known as the All-Union Spartakiad, while it involved participation of countries (17) outside of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet_encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; From the start of the 1930s in the Soviet Union, spartakiads of trade unions and the [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo]] physical culture sports society took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet_encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s, spartakiads of the Peoples of the USSR, [[DOSAAF]] of the USSR, all-Union Spartakiads of students, international Spartakiads of friendly armies of socialist and developing countries, and others were introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet_encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The First All-Ukrainian Spartakiad took place in [[Kharkiv]] on September 9‚Äì29, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leksika.com.ua/10090203/ure/spartakiada Spartakiad] at [[Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butakova, Ye.

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR}}

In 1952 the Soviet Union decided to join the Olympic movement, and international Spartakiads ceased. However the term persisted for internal sports events in the Soviet Union of different levels, from local up to the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR ({{lang-ru|–°–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–∫–∏–∞–¥–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –°–°–°–†}}, Spartakiada narodov SSSR&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-uk|–°–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–∫—ñ–∞–¥–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—ñ–≤ –°–†–°–†}}; {{lang-lt|TSRS taut≈≥ spartakiada}}; {{lang-lv|PSRS tautu spartakiƒÅda}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The latter event was held twice in four years: Winter Spartakiad and Summer Spartakiad, with international participation.

The first Soviet Spartakiad was held in 1956. These events were of huge importance for Soviet sports. Everyone could participate in them - from ordinary people to top-level athletes. The number of participants, for example, in the 6th Summer Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR, was 90 million people (twice the number of athletes in the USSR in that time), including 8,300 [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|Masters of Sports of the USSR]]. And in the 3rd Winter Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR 20 million people took part, including some 1,000 Masters of Sports of the USSR.&lt;ref name=GSE/&gt; The Winter and Summer Spartakiads of the Peoples of the USSR were each commemorated on a series of [[postage stamp]]s, released in millions of copies (an example of such a stamp is pictured).&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of Postage Stamps of the USSR 1918‚Äì1974, {{ill-WD|Soyuzpechat|Q4261829|‚ÄúSoyuzpechat‚Äù Central Philatelic Agency}} (CPA) of the [[Ministry of Communications of the USSR]] publisher, Moscow, 1976. See also subsequent yearly catalogues.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1975 all summer finals were held in Moscow, later in other cities throughout the Union. The winter editions final were often held in [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk).

====List of Spartakiades of Peoples of USSR====
* Summer (1956, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, 1975, [[1979 Soviet Spartakiad|1979]], 1983, 1986, 1991)
* Winter (1962, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990)

There was also a &quot;Youth Spartakiad&quot;, and a &quot;Spartakiad of Trade Unions&quot; ({{lang-ru|–°–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–∫–∏–∞–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ—Å–æ—é–∑–æ–≤}}). The latter survived in a number of post Soviet republics, such as [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

===Czechoslovakia===
{{see also|Spartakiad (Czechoslovakia)}}
The name '''Spartaki√°da''' was also used for a [[mass gymnastics]] display [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3757706707929752013], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUtrL3NoGLc], which was held every five years at the [[Strahov Stadium]] in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], when the country was under communist rule. The first event of this name was held, however, already in 1921, and its initiator Ji≈ô√≠ Chaloupeck√Ω is credited as the inventor of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rozhlas.cz/leonardo/historie/_zprava/209629 Rozhlas.cz - Jak vzniklo slovo ‚Äûspartaki√°da‚Äú]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
{{see also|Spartakiad (Albania)}}
Six similar events were held in [[Albania]] during [[Communist Albania|communist]] rule as well (in 1959, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iliriadaportal.com/opinion-f34/lindja-zhdukja-dhe-rilindja-e-olimpizmit-shqiptar-t1669.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/cup.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Soviet Union organised the [[Friendship Games]], aimed at countries which boycotted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].

The '''Lusophony Games''' ({{lang-pt|Jogos da Lusofonia}}) is a multinational [[multi-sport event]] organized by the '''[[ACOLOP]]''', which involves athletes coming from [[Lusophone]] (Portuguese-speaking) countries, namely those belonging to the [[CPLP]] (Community of Portuguese Language Countries), but also others where there are significant Portuguese communities or that have a common past with Portugal.

Participating countries are founding members [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[East Timor]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Macau]] ([[PRC|Chinese SAR]]), [[Mozambique]], [[Portugal]] and [[S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe]], and associate members [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. In addition, [[Ghana]], [[Flores]] (an island of [[Indonesia]]), [[Mauritius]] and [[Morocco]] have also expressed the desire to participate in future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.auniao.com/ler.php?id=4348 |title=Jogos da Lusofonia - Portugal e √çndia s√£o valor acrescentado |publisher=A Uni√£o - Jornal Online |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event is similar in concept to the [[Commonwealth Games]] (for members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) and the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] (for the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] community).

==Sports==
So far there are not any regulations concerning the list of sports that should be included in the Games schedule. The sports chosen for the 1st edition were discussed and deliberated by the ACOLOP's members on general assembly, but without any principle of future 'core' and 'rotating' sports from a list of approved ones.

However, on 14 October 2006, the president of the organizing committee for the [[2009 Lusophony Games]], [[Jos√© Vicente de Moura]], mentioned the possibility of the ACOLOP proposing four or five core sports to be included on every future edition, plus the prerogative for the host country to propose three of four more to a maximum of nine sports. In 2009 edition (Lisbon) 1500 athletes participated from 12 countries. In the football tournament five U-20 national teams competed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arogeraldes.com/2009/07/lisboa-2009-cabo-verde-campeon.html |title=Lisboa 2009 Football tournament |publisher=Periodismo de f√∫tbol internacional |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport marked with an asterisk (*) means that it has a [[demonstration sport|demonstration event]].

In Australian culture sports carnivals are held to perform competitions in the individual or team disciplines like athletics, swimming or [[Surf Life Saving]]. Teams from different clubs or schools gather together for both individual point-score and team score. Often, the carnival is opened by a parade with the teams marching in uniforms and flags over the field of competition.

==Surf carnival==

[[Surf Life Saving Club]]s in [[Australia]] train their [[nippers]] and young [[surf lifesaving|life savers]] for competitions in ''surf carnivals''. Local, regional, state and nationwide competitions are held across the country. Junior carnivals compete for age groups starting from under-8 to under-14, while senior competitions among active surf life savers start from under-15 to ''veterans''. Veterans are athletes 30 years and older; the age groups are in 5-year blocks: 30‚Äì34, 35‚Äì39, 40‚Äì44, all the way up to 65+. Surf boat competitions start from 16+.

The '''World Police and Fire Games''' (WPFG) is a biennial athletic event, open to active and retired law enforcement and fire service personnel throughout the world. The WPFG Federation is an arm of the California Police Athletic Federation (CPAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games At A Glance|url=http://www.cpaf.org/wpfg|publisher=CPAF|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American non-profit organization.

The Games attract approximately 10,000 entrants, slightly fewer than the Summer [[Olympic Games]], and exceeding the third position holder, the [[Commonwealth Games]]. In the early 2010s, [[The United Kingdom]] hosted all three events consecutively; the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], [[England]], followed by the 2013 World Police and Fire Games in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], and ending with [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], hosting the 2014 [[Commonwealth Games]] - the first time all three events have been hosted by the same nation consecutively.

The host city of the 2015 World Police and Fire Game was [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in the United States, with venues located around the [[Washington metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games, Fairfax 2015|url=http://fairfax2015.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pier 95 Irene France WPFG jeh.jpg|thumb|French team in New York on a day [[Hurricane Irene|a hurricane]] cancelled competition in 2011]]
The California Police Olympics were first held in 1967. The concept evolved over the years and led to the creation of the World Police &amp; Fire Games Federation‚Äîa non-profit organization, run by the Californian Police Athletics Federation‚Äîin 1983. Two years later, in 1985, the first World Police &amp; Fire Games were held in [[San Jose, California]], USA, with nearly 5,000 competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2011wpfg.org/WPFGHistory/tabid/56/Default.aspx History of the World Police &amp; Fire Games]. 2011 World Police &amp; Fire Games. Retrieved 2011-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest WPFG games to date was held in New York, New York, USA with over 16,000 athletes in attendance, from 59 nations.&lt;ref name=2015Fairfax/&gt;

The most successful and best organised was in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23589848 BBC News - In pictures: World Police and Fire Games 2013].

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was described, by the President of the World Police and Fire Games Federation, Mike Graham, as &quot;the friendliest and best Games ever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23649271 BBC News - WPFG 'best and friendliest ever', says president of games].

The Montreal Firefighters Association has called for a boycott of the 2017 Games, which are to be held in their own city, in protest against forced changes to their collective agreements and pension funds by the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government. Labor unions representing over 100,000 firefighters and civil servants have joined Montreal's firefighters in this boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/firefighters-boycotting-2017-world-firefighters-games-in-montreal-1.3149582 | title=Firefighters boycotting 2017 World Firefighters Games in Montreal | publisher=CBC News | work=Kate McKenna | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wpfg2017.com/ | title=Montreal World Police and Fire Games Boycott | publisher=Montreal World Police and Fire Games | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universiade''' is an international [[multi-sport event]], organized for [[university]] athletes by the [[International University Sports Federation]] (FISU). The name is a combination of the words &quot;University&quot; and &quot;[[olympiad]]&quot;. The Universiade is often referred to in [[English language|English]] as the '''World University Games''' or '''World Student Games'''; however, this latter term can also refer to competitions for sub-University grades students, as well.{{cn|date=May 2016}} The Universiade is the largest{{vague|in term of what? number of competitors? events? nations?|date=May 2016}} multi-sport event in the world apart from the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fisu.net/en/Summer-Universiades-3490.html&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent games were in 2015: the Winter Universiade was split between Granada in Spain and ≈†trbsk√© Pleso and Osrblie in Slovakia, while the Summer Universiade was in Gwangju, Korea.

== Precursors ==
The idea of a global international sports competition between [[student-athlete]]s pre-dates the 1949 formation of the [[International University Sports Federation]] (FISU), which now hosts the Universiade. English peace campaigner [[Hodgson Pratt]] was an early advocate of such an event, proposing (and passing) a motion at the 1891 [[Universal Peace Congress]] in Rome to create a series of international student conferences in rotating host capital cities, with activities including art and sport. This did not come to pass, but a similar event was created in Germany in 1909 in the form of the [[Academic Olympia]]. Five editions were held from 1909 to 1913, all of which were hosted in Germany following the cancellation of an Italy-based event.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;Bell, Daniel (2003).

At the start of the 20th century, [[Jean Petitjean]] of France began to attempt to organise a &quot;University Olympic Games&quot;. After discussion with [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Petitjean was convinced not to use the word &quot;Olympic&quot; in the tournament's name.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; Petitjean, and later the [[Confederation Internationale des Etudiants]] (CIE), was the first to build a series of international events, beginning with the [[1923 International Universities Championships]]. This was followed by the renamed [[1924 Summer Student World Championships]] a year later and two further editions were held in 1927 and 1928. Another name change resulted in the [[1930 International University Games]]. The CIE's International University Games was held four more times in the 1930s before having its final edition in 1947.&lt;ref name=PU&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/wsg.htm World Student Games (pre-Universiade)].

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006159 005 Blick auf das Spielfeld und die Zuschauertrib√ºne.jpg|thumb|left|A student football match held at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students]]

A separate group organised [[1939 International University Games (unofficial)|an alternative university games]] in 1939 in [[Vienna]], in post-[[Anschluss]] Germany.&lt;ref name=PU/&gt; The onset of [[World War II]] ceased all major international student sport activities and the aftermath also led to division among the movement, as the CIE was disbanded and rival organisations emerged. The ''[[Union Internationale des √âtudiants]]'' (UIE) incorporated a university sports games into the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] from 1947‚Äì1962, including one separate, unofficial games in 1954. This event principally catered for Eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/uie.htm World Student Games (UIE)]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2014-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the closure of the CIE and the creation of the first UIE-organised games, FISU came into being in 1949 and held its own first major student sport event the same year in the form of the [[1949 Summer International University Sports Week]]. The Sports Week was held biennially until 1955. Like the CIE's games before it, the FISU events were initially Western-led sports competitions.&lt;ref name=PU/&gt;

Division between the largely Western European FISU and Eastern European UIE eventually began to dissipate among broadened participation at the [[1957 World University Games]]. This event was not directly organised by either group, instead being organised by Jean Petitjean in France (which remained neutral to the split), but all respective nations from the groups took part. The FISU-organised Universiade became the direct successor to this competition, maintaining the biennial format into the inaugural [[1959 Universiade]]. It was not until the 1957 World University Games that the Soviet Union began to compete in FISU events. That same year, what had previously been a European competition became a truly global one, with the inclusion of Brazil, Japan and the United States among the competing nations. The increased participation ultimately led to the establishment of the Universiade as the primary global student sport championship.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PU/&gt;

'''The World Games''', first held in 1981, are an international [[multi-sport event]], meant for [[sport]]s, or disciplines or events within a sport, that are not contested in the [[Olympic Games]]. The World Games are organised and governed by the [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA), recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). The World Games are held every four years, one year after the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. The next World Games will be held [[Wroc≈Çaw]]/Poland in [[World Games 2017|July 2017]].

A number of the sports that were on the programme of the World Games have been discontinued because they are now included in the programme of the [[Olympic Games]], for example [[badminton]], [[beach volleyball]], [[trampolining]], [[rugby sevens]], [[taekwondo]], [[triathlon]] and women's [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]]. Other sports have been Olympic sports in the past (like [[tug of war]]). 

Some of the sports that are held at the World Games are [[acrobatic gymnastics]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[orienteering]], [[body building]], [[powerlifting]], [[finswimming]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[billiards]], [[water skiing]], and [[dance sport]]. The sports that are included in the World Games are limited by the facilities available in the host city; no new facilities may be constructed for the games. Between 25 and 30 sports have included in the official programme of the World Games. In addition, the IWGA, in coordination with the host city, can invite some sport to participate in the &quot;invitational&quot; programme. No World Games medals are awarded to invitational sports. 

To become part of the World Games programme, the sport must be widely spread in the world  and the specific [[Sports governing body|international sports federation]] must be member of the IWGA.  
In each sport, only the best athletes or teams may participate, they are named by the international sports federations. In most classes, it is necessary to qualify by a top ranking at the [[world championships]] or a qualification tournament to be able to participate.

‚Ä† The Soviet Union, which amassed 36 total medals in 1989, is counted separately from its successor states, including Russia.  This is consistent with the separate counting of medals for other states that sub-divided into their constituent successor states following their initial participation in the World Games. These include Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic and Slovakia) and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

The '''Special Olympics World Games''' are an international [[sports|sporting]] competition for athletes with [[intellectual disabilities]], organized by [[Special Olympics]].

== Principles ==
Although local [[Special Olympics]] events and competitions are held around the world every day, the World Games are flagship events. The goal is to showcase the skills and accomplishments of people with intellectual disabilities on a global stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/special-olympics-world-games.aspx|title=Special Olympics: World Games Overview|work=specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Games feature more than a week of competitions involving thousands of athletes. Through media coverage of the Games, the stories and achievements of children and adults with intellectual disabilities are made known to millions of people worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics.org&quot; /&gt;

Special Olympics World Games take place every two years and alternate between Summer and Winter Games, a schedule similar to the [[Olympics]] and [[Paralympics]]. Attracting as many as 350,000 volunteers and coaches, plus several thousands of athletes, these World Games can be the world's largest sporting event of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialolympics.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;athens2011.org&quot;&gt;http://www.athens2011.org/en/games_info.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Special Olympics athletes can compete in 32 Olympic-style summer or winter sports. The athletes are adults and children with intellectual disabilities who can range from gifted, world-class competitors to average athletes to those with limited physical ability. It's a fundamental rule of Special Olympics competitions that athletes are matched up according to their ability and age. This ‚Äúdivisioning‚Äù process is an effort to make every competition fair, competitive and exciting for athletes as well as fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Sports-and-Games/Games/About_Competitions_Results_Schedules.aspx|title=Special Olympics: About Competitions Results Schedules|work=specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first International Special Olympics Summer Games were held in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], US, in 1968, while the first International Special Olympics Winter Games were held in February 1977 in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], [[Colorado]], US. In 1991, the name was officially changed from International Special Olympics Summer/Winter Games to Special Olympics World Summer/Winter Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/history.aspx|title=Special Olympics: History of Special Olympics|work=specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Special Olympics World Summer Games were held on June 25 ‚Äì July 4 in Athens, Greece, involving more than 6,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 170 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;athens2011.org&quot; /&gt;

The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in [[Pyeongchang County|PyeongChang]], [[South Korea]] from Jan. 29 ‚Äì Feb. 5, 2013. The Host Town program, in which families host Special Olympics athletes from around the world to help them acclimate to the host country and customs, began on Jan. 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2013sopoc.org/hb/en |title=Welcome World Winter Games PyeongChang 2013 |publisher=2013sopoc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent [[2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games]] were held in Los Angeles, California from July 25 ‚Äì Aug. 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la2015.org/ |title=Special Olympics World Summer Games ‚Äì Los Angeles 2015 |publisher=La2015.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games were to be the first Special Olympics World Summer Games held in the United States in 16 years since the 1999 Summer Games held in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The next World Winter Games will be the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Graz and Schladming in Styria, Austria. This marks a return: Salzburg and Schladming, Austria hosted the fifth Special Olympics World Winter Games in 1993. These were the first Special Olympics World Games held outside the United States. The 2017 World Winter Games will be held March 14-March 25, 2017. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2012/Austria_to_host_2017_Special_Olympics_World_Winter_Games.aspx Austria to host 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games].

The '''Central American and Caribbean Games''' (CAC or CACGs) are a multi-sport regional championships event, held quadrennial (every 4 years), typically in the middle (even) year between [[Summer Olympics]]. The Games are for countries in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], as well as for [[Mexico]], [[Bermuda]], and the South American countries of [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].

The Games are overseen by the [[Central American and Caribbean Sports Organization]] (CACSO) (the organization also goes by the acronym &quot;ODECABE&quot;, from its full Spanish name: '''''O'''rganizaci√≥n '''De'''portiva '''C'''entro'''a'''mericana y del Cari'''be''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.odecabe.org/ ODECABE website] www.odecabe.org; retrieved 2010-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to provide a step between sub-CACG-region Games held the first year following a Summer Olympics (e.g. Central American Games) and the Continental Championships, the [[Pan American Games]], held the year before the Summer Olympics.

The most recent CACGs took place in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://mayaguez2010.com/ Website of the XXI Central American and Caribbean Games] (http://mayaquez2010.com); retrieved 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014 Central American and Caribbean Games|next edition]] will take place in 2018 in [[Barranquilla, Colombia]].

==History==
The CACGs are the oldest continuing regional games in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacso.org/history.php History of CACSO] from the CACSO website (www.cacso.org); retrieved 2009-06-26.  {{wayback|url=http://www.cacso.org/history.php |date=20090725224511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and only the Olympics have run longer. [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Guatemala]] were the three countries present at the first games, which were then called the ''Central American Games''. In 1935 their name was changed to ''Central American and Caribbean Games'' to reflect expanding participation. Thirty one nations took part in the 1993 games in [[Puerto Rico]] and the 1998 games in [[Venezuela]]. The [[2006 Central American and Caribbean Games]] ended on July 30, 2006.

A &quot;Central American Games&quot; does exist today, Juegos Centroamericanos, involving just [[Central America]]n countries.

==Editions==
The first two editions of the games were known as the &quot;Central American Games&quot; at the time, but the edition lineage continued after the inclusion of the Caribbean in 1935.

The '''Islamic Solidarity Games''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ£ŸÑÿπÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∂ÿßŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸä}}) is a multinational, [[multi-sport event]]. The Games involve the elite athletes of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. The [[Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation]] (ISSF) is the organisation that is responsible for the direction and control of the Islamic Solidarity Games.

==History==
The first event was held in 2005 in [[Saudi Arabia]] and there are currently 57 members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Non-Muslim citizens in the member countries are also allowed to take part in the Games.

A second event, originally scheduled to take place in October 2009 in [[Iran]], and later re-scheduled for April 2010, was canceled after a dispute arose between Iran and the [[Arab World]] over the use of the term [[Persian Gulf]] in logos for the Games, as some countries in the Arab world use the term &quot;Arabian Gulf&quot; to refer to the Persian Gulf. [[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Dispute over the name]] has been a recurring source of disharmony between Arab states and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/17/islamic-solidarity-games-cancelled|title= Islamic Solidarity Games cancelled after gulf row divides nations|publisher=Guardian/Associated Press|accessdate=18 January 2010 | location=London | date=17 January 2010 | first=Riyadh | last=Ap}}&lt;/ref&gt; latest edition took place in 2013 in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.riaudailyphoto.com/2011/11/islamic-solidarity-games-riau-2013-3rd.html|title=ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY GAMES : RIAU 2013 - 3rd Islamic Solidarity Games|publisher=Riau Daily Photo|accessdate=18 December 2011 | location= | date= | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth edition (2017) will be held in [[Baku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/baku-wins-the-2017-islamic-solidarity-games-hosting-bid.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=51561&amp;NewsCatID=371|title= Baku wins the 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games hosting bid|publisher=[[H√ºrriyet Daily News]]|accessdate=29 July 2013| date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goodwill Games''' was an international sports competition created by [[Ted Turner]] in reaction to the political troubles surrounding the [[Olympic Games]] of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/22/sports/goodwill-games-turner-s-games-losing-money-are-dropped.html|title= GOODWILL GAMES; Turner's Games, Losing Money, Are Dropped |author=Jere Longmsn|publisher= [[The New York Times]] |date = December 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] caused the [[United States]] and other [[Western world|Western countries]] to boycott the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], an act reciprocated when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries (with the exception of [[Romania]]) boycotted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

Like the Olympics, the Goodwill Games were held every four years (with the exception of the final Games), and had a summer and winter component. The Summer Goodwill Games occurred five times, between 1986 and 2001, while the Winter Goodwill Games occurred only once, in 2000. They were cancelled by [[Time Warner]], which had bought ownership of them in 1996, due to low television ratings.

==Overview==
The first Games, held in Moscow in [[1986 Goodwill Games|1986]], featured 182 events and attracted over 3,000 athletes representing 79 countries. World records were set by [[Sergey Bubka]] ([[pole vault]]), [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]] ([[heptathlon]]), and both the men and women's 200&amp;nbsp;m cycle racing, by East Germany's [[Michael H√ºbner]] and the Soviet Union's [[Erika Salum√§e]], respectively. World records also fell at the [[1990 Goodwill Games|1990 Games]] in [[Seattle]], to [[Mike Barrowman]] in the 200&amp;nbsp;m breaststroke and [[Nadezhda Ryashkina]] in the [[Racewalking|10 km walk]].

The [[1994 Goodwill Games|1994 Games]] were held in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, in the first competition since the Soviet Union had been replaced by fifteen independent republics. Russians set five world records in the [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] section, and the games were the first major international event to feature [[beach volleyball]], which would appear at the Olympics for the first time at the [[1996 Atlanta Games]]. Ted Turner's last games were in [[1998 Goodwill Games|1998]] in New York City, with memorable highlights including Joyner-Kersee winning her fourth straight heptathlon title, and the U.S. 4 √ó 400 m relay team setting a world's best time.

The games were bought from Ted Turner by [[Time Warner]] in 1996 when Time Warner acquired his company, the [[Turner Broadcasting System]].

Time Warner organized the [[2001 Goodwill Games|2001 Games]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]], before announcing that this would be the last edition of the games. The 2001 edition witnessed Australia win the most medals with 75, but it received very low [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] in the United States. Nevertheless, critics praised [[Turner Network Television]] for showing the games live, rather than on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]].

During a live interview at the 2009 Denver [[SportAccord]] conference, Turner blamed the demise of the games on the short-sighted management of Time Warner, and stated that &quot;If I'd have stayed there the Goodwill Games would not have been canceled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SportAccord interview&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubt_ef7kUmU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=655s Ted Turner interview, Dever SportAccord 2009], ''[[YouTube]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=31908&lt;/ref&gt; Turner expressed hope that the games would return, as a bridge to restore cultural contact between [[Russia]] and America, stating that the relationship between the two had steadily disintegrated since the Cold War, which he called a dangerous situation due to both countries' massive nuclear arsenals. He also reiterated his belief in the power of international sporting competitions to prevent war, stating that &quot;as long as the Olympics are taking place and not being boycotted, it's virtually impossible to have a world war&quot;, because the nations involved &quot;wouldn't want a war to mess up their chances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportAccord interview&quot; /&gt;

The '''Games of the New Emerging Forces''' ('''GANEFO''') were the games set up by [[Indonesia]] as a counter to the [[Olympic Games]].  Established for the athletes of the so-called &quot;[[emerging nation]]s&quot; (mainly newly independent [[socialist]] states), GANEFO was the name given both to the games held in [[Jakarta]] in 1963 and the 36-member sporting federation established the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Emerging Forces|last=Modelski|first=George|publisher=Australian National University, Research School of Pacific Studies|year=1963|isbn=|location=Canberra|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second GANEFO scheduled for [[Cairo]] in 1967 was cancelled and GANEFO had only one subsequent event, an &quot;Asian GANEFO&quot; held in [[Phnom Penh]] in 1966.

== Sports and politics at GANEFO ==
[[Indonesia]] established GANEFO in the aftermath of IOC censure for the politically charged 4th edition of [[1962 Asian Games|Asian Games in 1962]] in [[Jakarta]] which Indonesia hosted and for which [[Chinese Taipei|Taiwan]] and [[Israel]] were refused entry cards. The IOC's eventual reaction was to indefinitely suspend Indonesia from the IOC. Indonesia had ‚Äúthrown down a challenge to all international amateur sports organizations, which cannot very well be ignored,‚Äù in the words of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]]. This was the first time the IOC suspended one of its members, although Indonesia was readmitted in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=ttp://doc.rero.ch/record/24926/files/?ln=en|title=The Olympic Movement‚Äôs Response to the Challenge of Emerging Nationalism in Sport: An Historical Reconsideration of GANEFO|last=Field|first=Russell|publisher=University of Manitoba|year=2011|isbn=|location=Winnipeg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten countries (Cambodia, China, Guinea, Indonesia, Iraq, Mali, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the USSR) announced plans to form GANEFO in April 1963, and 36 countries signed on as members in November 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; GANEFO made it clear in its constitution that [[politics]] and [[sport]] were intertwined; this ran against the doctrine of the [[International Olympic Committee]], which strove to separate politics from sport. Indonesian president [[Sukarno]] responded that the IOC was itself political because it did not have the [[China|People's Republic of China]] or [[North Vietnam]] as members; the IOC was simply &quot;a tool of the imperialists and colonialists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, the IOC decreed that the athletes attending GANEFO would be ineligible to participate in the Olympic Games.

[[Sukarno]] would later form, with Chinese support, a ''Conference of New Emerging Forces, or'' [[CONEFO]] (''Conference of New Emerging Forces).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://megamercusuar.blogspot.ca/2012/02/conefo-conference-of-new-emerging.html|title=Fakta Sejarah: CONEFO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participating Nations in 1st GANEFO===
The first edition of GANEFO was held in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] on November 10‚Äì22, 1963 for 13 days. Athletes from 46 nations dispatched about 2,700 athletes and 7 nations sent staff and officials. In total, 51 nations participated in the Games from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America such as [[Afghanistan]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Burma]], [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953-70)|Cambodia]], [[Chile]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Cuba]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[North Korea|DPR Korea]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[East Germany]], [[Guinea]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]], [[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[China|China PR]], the [[Philippines]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[Republic of Mali|Mali]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Soviet Union]], [[North Vietnam]], the [[United Arab Republic]] (currently [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]), [[Uruguay]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], etc. Unlike the Olympics, there was also a team representing &quot;Arab [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrG3joA9QMI|title=GANEFO opening ceremony footage|last=|first=|date=1963|website=Youtube|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No country, however, was represented officially by its national Olympics committee, for fear of IOC reprisals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; For instance, the [[Soviet Union]], in a show of solidarity, sent athletes to the first GANEFO, but in order not to jeopardize their position in the IOC, the Soviet athletes were not of Olympic caliber. Japan let their athletes of non-Olympic caliber attend the first Ganefo to take account of the host nation's position of [[1964 Summer Olympics]].

The second edition of GANEFO had been planned to be held in [[Cairo]], [[the United Arab Republic]] in 1967, but this was canceled due to political considerations.

The second GANEFO was held in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in November 25-December 6, 1966.

=== Participating Nations in 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO)===
About 2,000 athletes participated in the 2nd edition of GANEFO from 17 nations ([[Cambodia]], [[Ceylon]], [[People's Republic of China|China PR]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korea]], [[Laos]], [[Lebanon]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Singapore]], [[Syria]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Yemen]]). The games were opened by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]], the prime minister of Cambodia.

The second GANEFO was restricted to Asia, except [[Guinea]] which participated in the qualifying tournament in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] in August 1‚Äì11, 1965. Consequently, only 17 Asian countries participated in the second tournament in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in November 25-December 6, 1966 which was named '1st [[Asian GANEFO]]'.

===Medal table at 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO)===
In the second edition of GANEFO, [[People's Republic of China|China PR]] was the highest ranking nation with 108 gold medals, [[North Korea]] the second, and [[Cambodia]] the third.

==2nd Asian GANEFO==
In September 1967 was announced a second Asian GANEFO to be held in [[Beijing]], [[China]], in 1970, but later Beijing dropped the plans to host the Games, which were then awarded to [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]].  But the Games never occurred and the GANEFO organisation collapsed.

[[File:Abertura Jogos Panamericanos 2 13072007.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pan American Games]] is one of the largest multi-sport events and involves athletes from the Americas.]]

A '''multi-sport event''' is an organized [[sport]]s event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) [[nation state]]s. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the modern [[Olympic Games]].

Many regional multi-sport events have since been founded and modeled after the Olympics. Most have the same basic structure. Games are held over the course of several days in and around a &quot;host city&quot;, which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports.  Athletes or teams are awarded [[gold medal|gold]], [[silver medal|silver]] or [[bronze medal]]s for first, second and third place respectively. The games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.

== History ==
The [[Ancient Olympic Games]], first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the [[Modern Olympic Games]], although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.

There were several other &quot;games&quot; held in Europe in the [[classical antiquity|classical era]]:

* [[Panhellenic Games]]:
** ''The [[Pythian Games]]'' (founded 527 BC) held in [[Delphi]] every four years
** ''The [[Nemean Games]]'' (founded 516 BC) held in [[Argolid]] every two years
** ''The [[Isthmian Games]]'' (founded 523 BC) held on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] every two years
* The [[Roman Games]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and [[wrestling]], as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage.

Other multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in England in the 1600s, the [[Highland games]] in [[Scotland]], and the Olympiade de la R√©publique in France in the 1800s.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international [[women's sport]] began to develop, events such as the [[Women's World Games]] and [[Olympics of Grace]] were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeighBonin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leigh | first = Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Th√©r√®se M. | title = The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women  | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 72‚Äì83 | publisher = North American Society for Sport History | year = 1977 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf | accessdate = 3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience ==
Since the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities. These affiliations include:

* regional, such as the [[East Asian Games]] and the [[South American Games]]
* political, such as the [[Spartakiad]] and the [[GANEFO]]
* historic or historicultural roots, such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] (for members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) and the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] (for members of [[La Francophonie]])
* ethnocultural or ethnoreligious, such as the [[Pan-Armenian Games]] (for ethnic communities of Armenians both in Armenia and in other countries) and the [[Maccabiah Games]] (for communities of Jews of both ethnic and religious origins)
* religious, such as the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]] and the previously mentioned Maccabiah Games
* occupational, such as the [[Military World Games]], the [[World Police and Fire Games]] and the [[Universiade]]
* physical disabilities, such as the [[Paralympics]] and the [[Deaflympics]]
* intellectual disabilities, such as the [[Special Olympics World Games]]
* human age, such as the [[World Masters Games]], [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] and the [[Senior Olympics]]
* gender and sexual orientation, such as the [[Women's Islamic Games]] and the [[Gay Games]]

==Olympic Games==
{{Main|Olympic Games}}

The first modern multi-sport [[Sports competition|event]] organised were the Olympic Games, organised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) (est. 1894) for the first time in 1896 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.

==Special Olympics==
{{Main|Special Olympics World Games}}

The first Special Olympics International Summer Games were held in Chicago, Ill., in 1968. The most recent Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece, involved 22 sports and approximately 7,000 athletes from 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.athens2011.org/en/sports.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paralympic Games==
{{Main|Paralympic Games}}

The Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities, and is organised by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC). Arranged for the first time in 1960 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.

==Other events==
At the beginning of the 20th century, another multi-sport event, the [[Nordic Games]] were first held. These Games were held in [[Scandinavia]], and the sports conducted were winter sports such as [[cross-country skiing]] and [[speed skating]]. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in [[Chamonix]] was declared the first [[Olympic Winter Games]].

In the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was&amp;nbsp;‚Äî basically&amp;nbsp;‚Äî the case with the Olympic Games. The Soviets organised the first [[Spartakiad]] in 1920, a communist alternative to the 'bourgeois' Olympic Games, and in 1922 the University Olympia was organised in [[Italy]], the forerunner of the [[World University Games]], meant for students only. Regional Games were another kind of multi-sport event that was established, such as the [[Far Eastern Championship Games]] or the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]].

==List of International multi-sport competitions==
{{Main|List of multi-sport events}}
The Olympic Games are still the largest multi-sport event in the world in terms of worldwide interest and importance (though no longer in participation), but several others also have significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">The '''Gymnasiade''', or '''World Gymnasiade''', is an international [[multi-sport event]] which is organised by the [[International School Sport Federation]] (ISF). It is the largest event among many other sport events held by the ISF. The fifteenth ISF Gymnasiade was organised Brazil in 2013 with more than 1700 young athletes representing 37 countries. Aligned with the philosophy of the organisation, only pupils between the ages of 13 and 18 are eligible to compete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/bm/isf.htm ISF World Gymnasiade]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2009-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four main sporting competitions at each Gymnasiade: [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[artistic gymnastics]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]], and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Other disciplines may be added upon the request of the organising country, such as trampoline, aerobics. There are 34 athletics events (17 for boys and 17 for girls), which are held in agreement with the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] rules. The events are split equally between the genders. Demonstration sports will be displayed as part of the programme. These are Judo, Karate, Wrestling, Chess, Tennis, Archery.

The first edition of the Gymnasiade was held in 1974 in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]] and it featured solely gymnastics competitions and swimming. The athletics competition was added to the programme in the following edition in [[Orl√©ans]] in 1976. The Gymnasiade continued as a biennial event until 1990, when it was altered to a quadrennial schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;&gt;[http://www.gymnasiade.com/Doha_GYM_2009_Bulletin_3_ENG.pdf Bulletin 03].

The '''Gay Games''' is the world's largest sporting and cultural event founded by [[Tom Waddell]], and specifically for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) athletes, artists and musicians.&lt;ref name=sobig&gt;[http://gaygames.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/lgbtolympics.pdf The History of LGBT Participation in the Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 Gay Games, held in New York City to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the [[Stonewall Riots]], the modern start of the LGBT movement, &quot;overtook the Olympics in size&quot; with 10,864 athletes compared to 9,356 at the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]] and 10,318 at the [[1996 Atlanta Olympics]].&lt;ref name=sobig/&gt; Founded as the '''Gay Olympics''', it was started in the United States in [[San Francisco, California]], in 1982, as the brainchild of Olympic decathlete (Mexico City 1968) and medical doctor [[Tom Waddell]], whose goals were to promote the spirit of inclusion and participation, as well as to promote the pursuit of personal growth in a sporting event. It retains similarities with the [[Olympic Games]], including the Gay Games flame which is lit at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5853139,00.html &quot;Cologne gears up to play and party as host to Gay Games&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The games are open to all who wish to participate, without regard to sexual orientation and there are no qualifying standards. Competitors come from many countries, including those where homosexuality remains illegal and hidden.

The [[Federation of Gay Games]] (FGG) is the sanctioning body of the Gay Games. From its statement of concept and purpose:
{{quote|''The purpose of The Federation of Gay Games, Inc.

On March 17, 2009, the FGG announced that groups from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]], were finalists for the bidding to host Gay Games IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaygamesblog.blogspot.fr/2009/03/3-cities-submit-full-bidbooks-for-2014.html |title=Federation of Gay Games press release on submission of bid books for Gay Games IX |publisher=Federation of Gay Games |date= March 17, 2009 |accessdate= January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2009, at the FGG Site Selection Meeting in Cologne, Germany, Cleveland was chosen as presumptive host of Gay Games IX in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaygamesblog.blogspot.fr/2009/09/gay-games-in-clevelanin-2014.html |title=Federation of Gay Games blog post on choice of host of Gay Games IX |publisher=Federation of Gay Games |date= September 29, 2009 |accessdate= January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host organization, Cleveland Special Events Corporation, later expanded the host city to include nearby Akron, Ohio. They also chose to style their event as &quot;Gay Games 9&quot; rather than the traditional Roman numeral &quot;Gay Games IX&quot;.

The Cuyahoga County Republican Party hoped to use the event as an opportunity to showcase how welcoming and friendly the Republican Party can be to the LGBT community. They hope that this will help them attract LGBT voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kucinich|first1=Jackie|title=Cuyahoga County Republicans welcome Gay Games to Cleveland|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/10/cuyahoga-country-republicans-welcome-gay-games-to-cleveland/|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groups were from Amsterdam, the Netherlands; [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]]; [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]; [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], United States; Paris, France; and a group proposing to host the Gay Games in either [[Rio de Janeiro]] or [[S√£o Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

By August 31, 2012, a letter of intent to bid were received from all groups except those in Brazil.

In December 2012, the FGG announced that several requests from bidders to add new sports to the program of the games. Of these requests, that for the inclusion of polo was rejected, while those for archery, boxing, fencing, p√©tanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were approved. Of these, boxing, p√©tanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were included in the bids of the three finalist bidding organizations.

Bid books were provided by February 28, 2013 with a Q&amp;A held over April &amp; May 2013. A shortlisting vote took place on May 31, 2013 resulting in the shortlisting of Limerick, London and Paris as the final three cities to continue on the 2018 Bid cycle. Shortlisted cities received a 4-day visit (inspection sites) from a team of FGG inspectors (4 delegates + 1 CM) in July 2013. The final vote took place in Cleveland (Ohio, USA) during the 2013 Annual General Assembly. On 7 October, Paris was elected host city for the 2018 Gay Games.

== Controversies ==

=== Lawsuit over 'Gay Olympics' name{{anchor | Naming controversy}} ===
Dr. [[Tom Waddell]], the former Olympian who helped found the games, intended them to be called the &quot;Gay Olympics&quot;, but a lawsuit filed less than three weeks before 1982's inaugural Gay Olympics forced the name change.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfbg&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Savannah |last=Blackwell |url=http://www.sfbg.com/News/35/49/49olysb2.html |title=Crushing the Gay Olympics: The USOC's homophobic past |publisher=[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |date=September 5, 2001 |accessdate=January 4, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060527003250/http://www.sfbg.com/News/35/49/49olysb2.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Event organizers were sued by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) under the U.S. [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]], which gave the USOC exclusive rights to the word ''Olympic'' in the United States. Defendants of the lawsuit contended that the law was capriciously applied and that if the Nebraska Rat Olympics and the Police Olympics were not similarly prohibited, the Gay Olympics should not be either.&lt;ref name=&quot;joeclark&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Clark |url=http://www.joeclark.org/glory.html |title=Glory of the Gay Games |year=1994 |accessdate=January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, like Jeff Sheehy, coauthor of San Francisco's domestic-partner legislation and former president of the [[Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club]], believed [[homophobia]] to be a motivation behind the lawsuit. They cited the authorized use of the word &quot;Olympics&quot; by the [[Special Olympics]] and other organizations as evidence of this homophobia.&lt;ref name=&quot;joeclark&quot; /&gt;

Others, like Daniel Bell, cite the IOC's long history of protecting the Olympics brand as evidence that the lawsuit against the &quot;Gay Olympics&quot; was not motivated by discrimination against gays. Since 1910 the IOC has taken action, including lawsuits and expulsion from the IOC, to stop certain organizations from using the word &quot;Olympics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;danbell&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bell, Daniel |year=1998 |url=http://www.internationalgames.net/topics/gayolympics.htm  |title=Why Can't the Gay Games Be the Gay Olympics? |publisher=International Games Archive via archive.org|accessdate=June 12, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060307090517/http://www.internationalgames.net/topics/gayolympics.htm |archivedate = March 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual &quot;California Police Olympics&quot; were held for 22 years, from 1967 through 1989, after which, the word Olympics was no longer used for the event&lt;!-- run by the California Police Athletic Federation, called, since 2012, the &quot;United States Police and Fire Championships&quot;--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://uspfc.org/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled for the USOC in ''[[San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee]]''.

A 2009 documentary film, ''Claiming the Title: Gay Olympics on Trial'', was created in the United States and was previewed at several film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claimingthetitle.com/Claiming_The_Title/Home.html|title=Home|publisher=Acquarius Media|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1439534|Claiming the Title}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was also included in a 2005 film by David Sector, ''Take the Flame! Gay Games: Grace Grit &amp; Glory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0464233|Take the Flame! Gay Games: Grace Grit &amp; Glory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the lawsuit, the Olympics and the Gay Games have set aside their initial hostilities and worked cooperatively together,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} successfully lobbying to have HIV travel restrictions waived for the 1994 Gay Games in New York and the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta.

=== Plans to launch Gay Winter Games in Fall 1986 ===
Plans to launch a complementary Gay Winter Games, slated for February 1986 in [[Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul|Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota]], collapsed, due to a lack of sufficient funding and logistical problems. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} There have been no subsequent attempts to launch a Gay Winter Games since, although [[Whistler, British Columbia]], Canada, hosts an annual gay winter-sports festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noel|first1=Alyssa|title=Whistler Pride and Ski Festival wraps up another year |url=http://www.whistlerquestion.com/entertainment/arts/whistler-pride-and-ski-festival-wraps-up-another-year-1.1750331|accessdate=11 April 2015|work=Question|date=February 2, 2015|ref=http://www.whistlerquestion.com/entertainment/arts/whistler-pride-and-ski-festival-wraps-up-another-year-1.1750331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schism in LGBT sports communities over Gay Games&amp;nbsp;VII ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from 2 places: 1. Gay_Games#2006_Gay_Games_Chicago 2.  2006_Gay_Games#Originally_awarded_to_Montr.C3.A9al.2C_Canada --&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
In 2001, the bidding organization from Montreal, Canada, won the right to negotiate with the FGG for a licensing agreement to host the 2006 Gay Games, but after two years of failed negotiations Montreal broke off talks at the 2003 FGG annual meeting in Chicago. There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:

* The size of the event
* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point
* Financial transparency

In a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.

The Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].

Due to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike. Few teams were able to field complete squads for both events; In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.
There were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.&quot;

Since 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/&lt;/ref&gt; The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate. The Chicago Gay Games VII ended with no debt and all bills paid. In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with 5.3M Canadian dollars of debt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, {{Cn|date=April 2016}}meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames are being held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9161">The '''International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports (IWAS) World Games''' (or '''IWAS World Games''') are a multi-sport competition for [[Disabled sport|athletes with a disability]], which under the former name of the '''International Stoke Mandeville Games''' were the forerunner of the [[Paralympic Games]]. The competition has been formerly known as the '''World Wheelchair and Amputee Games''', the '''Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games''', the '''Stoke Mandeville Games''',  the '''World Wheelchair Games''', and in the 1960s and 1970s was often referred to as the Wheelchair Olympics.

The Games were originally held in 1948 by neurologist Sir [[Ludwig Guttmann]], who organized a sporting competition involving [[World War II]] veterans with [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] at the [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] rehabilitation facility in [[Aylesbury]], England, taking place concurrently with the first post-war [[1948 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in London. In 1952, the [[Netherlands]] joined in the event, creating the first international sports competition for the disabled. In 1960, the Ninth Stoke Mandeville Games were held in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], following that year's [[Olympic Games]]. These are considered to be the first [[Paralympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/09/02/f-paralympics-history.html |title=Paralympics traces roots to Second World War |date=September 5, 2008 |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |author=Randi Druzin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Olympic mascots|2012 Paralympic mascot]] [[Wenlock and Mandeville|Mandeville]] was named after Stoke Mandeville Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/8690467.stm BBC Wenlock and Mandeville]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paralympic Games evolved to include athletes from all disability groups, the Stoke Mandeville games continued to be organized as a multi-sport event for wheelchair athletes. Games were held annually in Aylesbury under the direction of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF), which became the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF).

In 1999, the World Wheelchair Games were held in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. In 2003, the Games were again held in Christchurch, and combined with a competition for [[amputee]] athletes organized by the International Sports Organization for the Disabled. In 2004, ISMWSF and ISOD merged to create the [[International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation]] (IWAS). The first games held under the name IWAS World Wheelchair and Amputee Games were held in 2005 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The second IWAS Games were held in 2007 in [[Chinese Taipei]] and the third IWAS games were held in Bangalore, India in November 2009.

==History==
The [[Slovenia]]n sports instructor [[Metod Klemenc]] founded the International Children's Games in 1968 with the aim of promoting peace and friendship through sports to the world's youth. He organised the first International Children's Games and Cultural Festival in 1968 with the participation of teams from nine European cities.

==Current activities==
Since that time, 37,000 children aged 12 to 15 have been in competition at 47 Summer Games and 6 Winter Games. 411 different cities, 86 countries and all 5 continents have participated. The International Children's Games and Cultural Festival has become the world's largest international multi-sport youth games, and is a recognised member of the International Olympic Committee. The International Children's Games in 2013 were held in Windsor-Essex, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infowindsor.com/international-childrens-games-windsor|title=Windsor-Essex Awarded International Children's Games 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Lake Macquarie]], Australia in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-29/lake-macquarie-wins-bid-for-international/885732|title=Lake Macquarie Awarded International Children's Games 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 cancellation===
In early 2005, the FAI Executive Board decided not to continue with the selection procedure for the organisation of World Air Games in 2005. The Board judged that there was insufficient time remaining for the two final bidders, Malaysia and Poland, to solve the various organisational problems. 
===WAG 2009===
The FAI announced on 27 October 2007 the opening of the bidding for the 2009 Games. [[Turin]] (Italy) has been chosen to host the World Air Games 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">The '''Commonwealth Youth Games''' are a small-scale version of the [[Commonwealth Games]], designed for the [[Youth (athletics)|youth]] of the 71 Commonwealth countries.

==History==
The first Commonwealth Youth Games were held in Scotland in August 2000  where 733 Athletes from 14 countries competed in 8 sports over 3 days. The  second edition of the Commonwealth Youth Games took place in Australia in December 2004 and saw over 1000 athletes and officials from 22 countries in a 10-sport programme. The third Youth Games were held in the Indian city of Pune from 12‚Äì18 October 2008 where 71 nations and territories participated in 9 sports. A decision was taken by the Commonwealth Games Federation at their General Assembly in 2005 to move the Youth Games outside of the Olympic Games year and in doing so awarded the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games to the Isle of Man. A decision was taken at the General Assembly in 2008 to award the 2015 Commonwealth Youth Games to Samoa and also to subsequently adjust the quadrennial cycle, so that future events will take  place in 2017, 2021 and so on. All competitors in the Commonwealth Youth Games will be a minimum of 14 and maximum of 18 in the year of competition (i.e. their 18th birthday is during the calendar year in which the Games is held) and a maximum number of 1000 competitors are invited to participate from every Commonwealth Games Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecgf.com/cyg/ Commonwealth Youth Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paralympic Games infobox}}
{{Disability}}

The '''Paralympic Games''' is a major international [[multi-sport event]], involving athletes with a range of [[physical disability|physical disabilities]], including impaired muscle power (e.g. [[paraplegia]] and [[quadriplegia]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[post-polio syndrome]], [[spina bifida]]), impaired passive range of movement,  limb deficiency (e.g. [[amputation]] or [[dysmelia]]),  leg length difference, [[short stature]], [[hypertonia]],  [[ataxia]], [[athetosis]], [[vision impairment]] and  [[intellectual impairment]]. There are [[Winter Paralympic Games|Winter]] and [[Summer Paralympic Games]], which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective [[Olympic Games]]. All Paralympic Games are governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).

The Paralympics has grown from a small gathering of British [[World War II]] veterans in [[Stoke Mandeville Games|1948]] to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the [[Olympic Games]], while the [[IOC]]-recognized [[Special Olympics World Games]] include athletes with [[intellectual disabilities]], and the [[Deaflympics]] include [[deaf]] athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deaflympics.com/news.asp?1131 The World Games for the Deaf and the Paralympic Games], [[International Committee of Sports for the Deaf]] (CISS), December, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=specialolympics&gt;[http://info.specialolympics.org/NR/rdonlyres/eygdoyu6qeskkk3pn56u5u62q2wo5alfxtsakkwc56svfiy3qzsgyukawqyplsdx2xxyphk24bx7nznqjvg7t4snyee/olympic_brochure.pdf Special Olympics and the Olympic Movement], Official website of the [[Special Olympics]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete.  The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types.  The categories are impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement,  limb deficiency,  leg length difference, [[short stature]], [[hypertonia]],  [[ataxia]], [[athetosis]], [[vision impairment]] and  [[intellectual impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/classification&lt;/ref&gt; These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport. The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over-stated their disabilities, in addition to the use of performance-enhancing drugs seen in other events.

==History==

===Forerunners===
{{Further|World Wheelchair and Amputee Games}}

[[File:RUSMARKA-1777.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Ludwig Guttmann]]]]
Athletes with disabilities did compete in the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics.  The first athlete to do so was [[German American]] gymnast [[George Eyser]] in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], who had one artificial leg. [[Hungary at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] [[Karoly Takacs]] competed in shooting events in both the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] Summer Olympics.  He was a right-arm amputee and could shoot left-handed.  Another disabled athlete to appear in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was [[Lis Hartel]], a [[Denmark at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Danish]] equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the [[Equestrian at the 1952 Summer Olympics|dressage]] event.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The first organized athletic day for disabled athletes that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, United Kingdom.  [[Germans|German born]] Dr. [[Ludwig Guttmann]] of [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accessibleportugal.com/revista/2008/Setembro/capa1.html | title=Paralympics History | author=Correia, Susana | work=Accessible Portugal Online Magazine | date=February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206205816/http://www.accessibleportugal.com/revista/2008/Setembro/capa1.html | archivedate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been helped to flee Nazi Germany by the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics]] (CARA) in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsl.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/spsl/spsl.html#spsl.A |title=SPSL Archive |publisher=Rsl.ox.ac.uk |date=1933-12-24 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted a sports competition for British [[World War II]] veteran patients with spinal cord injuries. The first games were called the [[World Wheelchair and Amputee Games|1948 International Wheelchair Games]], and were intended to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Paralympic Movement |publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee |url=http://www.paralympiceducation.ca/Content/History/11%20History%20of%20the%20Paralympics.asp?langid=1 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090802152653/http://www.paralympiceducation.ca:80/Content/History/11%20History%20of%20the%20Paralympics.asp?langid=1 |archivedate=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The games were held again at the same location in 1952, and Dutch veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its kind. These early competitions, also known as the Stoke Mandeville Games, have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), pp.38‚Äì39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milestones===
There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in [[1960 Summer Paralympics|1960]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympics traces roots to Second World War|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/2.720/paralympics-traces-roots-to-second-world-war-1.697123|accessdate=2010-04-14 | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galligan (2000), pp. 89‚Äì90&lt;/ref&gt; The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 Summer Games]], athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;  The [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, was another milestone for the Paralympic movement.  It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic Summer Games]], in the same host city, and using the same facilities.  This set a precedent that was followed in [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]], [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996]] and [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000]]. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 2001,&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and was recently extended through 2020.&lt;ref name=bbc-firstglobal&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympics 2012: London to host 'first truly global Games'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/18143145|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the [[1992 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]].

===Winter Games===
{{Main|Winter Paralympic Games}}

The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in [[1976 Winter Paralympics|1976]] in [[√ñrnsk√∂ldsvik]], Sweden.  This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete.&lt;ref name=winterhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Paralympic Games|publisher=Government of Canada|url=http://www.canada2010.gc.ca/101/histor/010203-eng.cfm|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Paralympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Paralympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Paralympics and the [[Winter Olympics]] have been held in those even numbered years separate from the Summer Games.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;

===Recent games===
The Paralympic games were designed to emphasize the participants' athletic achievements and not their disability. Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutipc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/about-us|title=About the IPC|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has grown dramatically since its early days ‚Äì for example, the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to over 3,900 athletes from 146 countries in Beijing in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Games|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/paralympic-games|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage. The Paralympics is no longer held solely for British war veterans or just for athletes in wheelchairs, but for elite athletes with a wide variety of disabilities from all over the world. The paralympics allow people with special needs a chance to heal their injuries and take part in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympics history|last=Rosner|first=David|publisher=CNNSI.com|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2000-10-18|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/paralympics/news/2000/10/18/paralympic_history/|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Paralympic Committee==
{{Main|International Paralympic Committee}}

===Forerunners (1964‚Äì1989)===
The first organization dedicated to advancement of athletic opportunities for people with a disability was the [[International Sports Organization for the Disabled]] (ISOD), founded in 1964.  The founders of this organization intended it to be a governing body to disability sports what the IOC was to the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw and Gavron (2005), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  This committee eventually became the [[International Coordinating Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled]] (ICC), which was established in 1982.  The ICC was tasked with advocating for the rights of athletes with a disability in front of the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe 2008, p. 43&quot;&gt;Howe (2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the cooperative effort between the ICC and the IOC, which resulted in the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the ICC determined the need to expand and include representatives from all nations that had disability sports programs.  They also deemed it necessary to include athletes in the decisions of the Paralympic governing body. Consequently, this body was reorganized as the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in 1989.&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe 2008, p. 43&quot;/&gt;

===IPC (since 1989)===
[[File:Germany Bonn IPC 2009 06 28.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A white building with trees next to it fronting a street with a car driving past|IPC headquarters in [[Bonn]]]]
The IPC is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. It comprises 176&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/national-paralympic-committees&lt;/ref&gt; National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/international-organization-for-the-disabled&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the IPC is [[Philip Craven]], a former Paralympian from Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/governing-board&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as head of the IPC, Craven is also a member of the International Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Philip Craven|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/sir-philip-craven-mbe|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPC's international headquarters are in [[Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/management-team&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games.  It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports ([[Paralympic athletics]], [[Paralympic swimming]], [[Paralympic shooting]], [[Paralympic powerlifting]], [[Para-alpine skiing]], [[Paralympic biathlon]], [[Paralympic cross-country skiing]], [[ice sledge hockey]] and [[Wheelchair DanceSport]]). This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutipc&quot;/&gt;  IPC membership also includes National Paralympic Committees &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and international sporting federations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/international-sport-federations&lt;/ref&gt; International Federations are independent sport federations recognized by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport. International Federations responsibilities include technical jurisdiction and guidance over the competition and training venues of their respective sports during the Paralympic Games. The IPC also recognizes media partners, certifies officials, judges, and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the [[Paralympic Charter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;movement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC_Handbook/|title=IPC Handbook|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2010-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005428/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC_Handbook/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPC has a cooperative relationship with the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions. The two governing bodies remain distinct, with separate Games, despite the close working relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Schantz (2008) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and symbols==

{{Main|Paralympic symbols}}

Although the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining &quot;paraplegic&quot; (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and &quot;Olympic,&quot; the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate. The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨, ''par√°'' (&quot;beside&quot; or &quot;alongside&quot;) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryofIPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/the-ipc/history-of-the-movement|title=History of the Movement|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1988 Summer Paralympics|Summer Games of 1988]] held in Seoul was the first time the term &quot;Paralympic&quot; came into official use.

‚ÄúSpirit in Motion‚Äù is the motto for the Paralympic movement.  The symbol for the Paralympics contains three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations.  The colours are each in the shape of an ''Agito'' (which is Latin for &quot;I move&quot;), which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement.  The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Symbol &amp; Motto|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Paralympic_Symbol_Motto.html|accessdate=2010-04-07 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006082850/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Paralympic_Symbol_Motto.html | archivedate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions.  The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it.  The vision of the IPC is, &quot;To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2008), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The Paralympic anthem is &quot;Hymn de l'Avenir&quot; or &quot;Anthem of the Future&quot;.  It was composed by [[Thierry Darnis]] and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC Intellectual Property Rights |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |format=PDF |url=http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/2010_03_10_Intellectual_Property_Bylaws_GB_Approved.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100619214303/http://paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/2010_03_10_Intellectual_Property_Bylaws_GB_Approved.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==

===Opening===
[[File:Paralympics Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A portion of the stadium with stands full of people, a large artificial tree is on the right side of the image.  A group of people are walking together on the stadium floor|Opening ceremony of the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]]]]

As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=OCprotocol1&gt;{{cite web|title= The Modern Olympic Games |chapter= The development of the Games ‚Äì Between festival and tradition |publisher= International Olympic Committee |page= 5 |url= http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_668.pdf |chapterurl= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf#pages=5 |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. Unlike the Olympic Games, after the national anthem, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation.Since the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]].The nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, though with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Since the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]], the host nation presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture.

Speeches are given, formally opening the games. Finally, the Paralympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier ‚Äî often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation ‚Äî who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic opening ceremony to be 'family friendly'|publisher=Canwest News Service|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=2010-03-12|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Paralympic+opening+ceremony+family+friendly/2676023/story.html|accessdate=2010-05-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140459/http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Paralympic+opening+ceremony+family+friendly/2676023/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing===
The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.
The [[Paralympic flag]] is taken down.Since the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]] the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played.  The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:gYE3_zHFNG4J:www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_1/2009_11_20_Intellectual_Property_Bylaws_GB_approved.pdf+IPC+Handbook+June+2009+Bylaws+Governance+and+Organizational+and+Organizational+Structure,&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiWjg41x66Augn939CIag30vfielmgvqkGvzutyt2JY14aQsNRFV8bL4vbCOx4T2bc2BbDPuMHJgrbh3qy0H3lYiiR6PGTtQe9R58CERqilz0voxEZ72xzSyyLEydWvz8fngwQI&amp;sig=AHIEtbS09CRj9i0kliXh-yulUy3h8fqCHQ IPC Handbook June 2009 Bylaws Governance and Organizational and Organizational Structure] (Google Quick View), [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC)&lt;/ref&gt;  After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.

===Medal presentation===

A medal ceremony is held after each Paralympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by an IPC member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medallists country plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/victory-ceremony-podiums-at-2010-winter-games-a-testament--to-the-mountains-athletes-have-climbed-en-route-to-olympic-and-paralympic-success_264996fr.html Victory Ceremony podiums at 2010 Winter Games a testament to the mountains athletes have climbed en route to Olympic and Paralympic success], The Official website of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games {{wayback|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/victory-ceremony-podiums-at-2010-winter-games-a-testament--to-the-mountains-athletes-have-climbed-en-route-to-olympic-and-paralympic-success_264996fr.html |date=20120828224204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceremony volunteers|publisher=Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/work-and-volunteer/volunteer-opportunities/ceremonies-volunteers/ Ceremonies Volunteers|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final.

==Equality==

===Relationship with the Olympics===
In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This agreement was to remain in effect until the [[2012 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref name=winterhistory/&gt; but was extended, encompassing all Summer and Winter games up until the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=agreement&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html |accessdate=2010-05-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908052424/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html | archivedate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its [[Olympic Charter|charter]], which states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|page=11|year=2010|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Charter_en_2010.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play....Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.}}
While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Schantz (2008) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter, which forbids discrimination on the basis of political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual orientation or racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Vision and Mission|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|format=PDF|year=2003|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120203111830492_sec_i_chapter_1.1_paralympic_vision_and_mission_0.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairman of the [[London organising committee]], [[Sebastian Coe]], said about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, England, that {{cquote|We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/04/sainsburys-sponsors-paralympic-games | location=London | title=Sainsbury's announces sponsorship of 2012 Paralympics | date=2010-05-04 | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2014 Winter Paralympic Games]] is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their [[Russia at the 2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympic team]] topped the medal table at the [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympics]], while their [[Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic team]] performed well below expectations at the [[2010 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]]. This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/russia-paralympic-team-success/|title=Russia‚Äôs Paralympic breakthrough in Vancouver|work=[[Russia Today]]|date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/disabled-athletes-show-up-olympics-team/402021.html|title=Disabled Athletes Show Up Olympics Team|newspaper=[[Moscow Times]]|date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Federation]] organizers of the [[2014 Winter Paralympic Games]] have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sochi-paralympics-confronts-russia-s-attitude-towards-disabled-1.2558404 | work=CBC News | title=Sochi Paralympics confronts Russia's attitude towards disabled - World - CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralympians at the Olympics====

{{See also|List of athletes who have competed in the Paralympics and Olympics}}
[[Paralympian|Paralympic athletes]] have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games.  The precedent was set by [[Neroli Fairhall]], a Paralympic archer from [[New Zealand at the Paralympics|New Zealand]], who competed at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Neroli Fairhall, Champion Archer, Dies at 61|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2006-06-13|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/13/sports/13fairhall.html|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Oscar Pistorius]], a [[South Africa at the Paralympics|South African]] sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by [[Ossur]]. He holds Paralympic world record in the 400&amp;nbsp;meter event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/world-records/athletics&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pistorius missed qualifying for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in the 400&amp;nbsp;meter race, by 0.70&amp;nbsp;seconds. He qualified for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400&amp;nbsp;meter sprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=An Amputee Sprinter: Is He Disabled to Too-Abled|last=Longman|first=Jere|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2007-05-15|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/sports/othersports/15runner.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Pistorius qualified for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and competed in two events: he made the semi-final in the [[400 metres]] race; and his team came 8th in the final of the [[4 √ó 400 metres relay]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paralympics 100m: Oscar Pistorius says past experience vital|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/18146074|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics; The [[sighted guide]]s for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2010/03/13/visually_impaired_skiers_put_fate_in_guides_hands.html Visually impaired skiers put fate in guide's hands], thestar.com, March 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
There has been criticism for not providing equal funding to Paralympic athletes as compared to Olympic athletes.  An example of this criticism was a lawsuit filed by Paralympic athletes [[Tony Iniguez]], [[Scot Hollonbeck]] and [[Jacob Heilveil]] of the [[United States at the Paralympics|United States]], in 2003.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/sports/othersports/07paralympics.html Court Lets Ruling Stand in U.S.O.C. Case], [[New York Times]], October 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They alleged that the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC), which also include the USOC Paralympic Division (the National Paralympic Committee), was underfunding American Paralympic athletes. Iniguez cited the fact that the USOC made healthcare benefits available to a smaller percentage of Paralympians, the USOC provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at a Paralympics. US Paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for the US Paralympic athletes, as nations such as Canada and Britain supported Paralympians and Olympians virtually equally. The USOC did not deny the discrepancy in funding and contended that this was due to the fact that it did not receive any government financial support.  As a result, it had to rely on revenue generated by the media exposure of its athletes.  Olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for the USOC than Paralympic athletic achievements.  The case was heard by lower courts, who ruled that the USOC has the right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates.  The case was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympic Athletes Add Equality to Their Goals|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|publisher=NYTimes.com|work=The New York Times|date=2008-09-05|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/sports/othersports/06paralympics.html|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; where on September 6, 2008 it announced that it would not hear the appeal. However, during the time the lawsuit lasted (from 2003 to 2008), the funding from the USOC had nearly tripled. In 2008 $11.4&amp;nbsp;million was earmarked for Paralympic athletes, up from $3&amp;nbsp;million in 2004.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

As with the Olympics, recent Paralympics have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.&lt;ref name=paralympic-twists&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Paralympics reignite the Olympic buzz but with added twists|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/30/london-paralympics-olympics-differences-similiarities|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], the Paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence.

Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976, but this early coverage was confined to taped-delay releases to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45&amp;nbsp;hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman and Darcy (2008), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games.  A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and All Media Sports (AMS) to broadcast the Games internationally.  Deals were reached with Asian, South American, and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible. The Games were also webcast for the first time. Because of these efforts the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman and Darcy (2008), pp. 100‚Äì101&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996]] Games.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin and Newell (2003), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these advances consistent media attention has been a challenge, which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the [[2010 Winter Paralympics]].

The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one-hour highlight program after the Games ended. For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage. The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the &quot;time zone factor&quot; necessitated a limited broadcast schedule.&lt;ref name=bbcmedia&gt;{{Cite news|title=BBC criticised for scant coverage of Winter Paralympics|last=Sweney|first=Mark|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|date=2010-03-12|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/12/bbc-criticised-coverage-winter-paralympics|accessdate=2010-04-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], which was watched by 23% of the population of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=bbcmedia/&gt; In Norway, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live.

Commercial broadcaster [[Channel 4]] acquired the rights to the Paralympics in the United Kingdom for the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], and planned to air extensive coverage of the games; Channel 4 aired 150 hours of coverage, and also offered [[mobile app]]s, and three dedicated streaming channels of additional coverage on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Freesat]], [[Virgin Media]] and Channel 4's website.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/unprecedented-rolling-coverage-london-2012 |title=Unprecedented Rolling Coverage for London 2012 &amp;#124; IPC |publisher=Paralympic.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 also made a push to heighten the profile of the Paralympics in the country by producing a 2 minute trailer for its coverage, &quot;Meet the Superhumans&quot;; which premi√®red simultaneously on over 70 commercial channels in the UK on 17 July 2012.&lt;ref name=adott-c4paralympics&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad of the Day: Paralympic Games Forget the Olympics.

==Classification==
{{Main|Disability sport classification}}
[[Image:Paralympic XC ski sitting.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A woman sitting on sit-skis, she is pushing herself with two poles|[[Olena Iurkovska]] of [[Ukraine at the 2010 Winter Paralympics|Ukraine]] competing on cross-country sit-skis at the 2010 Winter Paralympics.]]

The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) has established ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.

===Categories===
The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category.  These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics.&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;&gt;http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120716152047682_classificationguide_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical Impairment''' - There are eight different types of physical impairment:
* '''Impaired muscle power''' - With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced, e.g. due to spinal-cord injury, [[spina bifida]] or [[polio]].
* '''Impaired passive range of movement''' - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. Acute conditions such as [[arthritis]] are not included.
* '''Loss of limb or limb deficiency''' - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from [[amputation|partial or total loss]] due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency (e.g. [[dysmelia]]).
* '''Leg-length difference''' - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma.
* '''Short stature''' - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures.
* '''[[Hypertonia]]''' - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy).
* '''[[Ataxia]]''' - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]], [[Friedreich‚Äôs ataxia]]).
* '''[[Athetosis]]''' - Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]], [[choreoathetosis]]).

'''Visual Impairment''' -  Athletes with [[visual impairment]] ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged [[legal blindness|legally blind]], to total [[blindness]]. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex).&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;/&gt; The [[sighted guide]]s for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with sighted [[goalkeepers]] in [[5-a-side football]] became eligible to receive medals of their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-ablebodied&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19422244 |title=Paralympics 2012: The able-bodied athletes at the Games |publisher=BBC News |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual Disability''' - Athletes with a significant [[developmental disability|impairment in intellectual functioning]] and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;paralympic.org&quot;/&gt; However, the [[IOC]]-recognized [[Special Olympics World Games]] are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=specialolympics/&gt;&lt;ref name=categories&gt;{{Cite news|title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=2000-10-06 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification system===
Within the disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to level of impairment.  The classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many athletes as possible who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities.  Consequently, there is a range of impairment within most classifications .&lt;ref name=classdescribed&gt;{{cite web|title=Athlete Classification|publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/Classification/AthleteClassification.aspx|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217162608/http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/Classification/AthleteClassification.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical classification (until 1980s)====
From its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in.  For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation.  The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis.  It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.&lt;ref name=classification&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of classification|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|format=PDF|url=http://www.paralympic.org/classification/history|accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Functional classification (since 1980s)====
[[File:Goalball vid Paralympics i Aten.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three men wearing eye shades laying on the floor, a red ball is to the left of the image|The Swedish goalball team at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]]]]

While there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s.  In a functional system the focus is on what impact the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance.  Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial.  The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by [[International Blind Sport Federation]] (IBSF0), which still uses a medically based system.&lt;ref name=classification/&gt;

Some sports are only held for certain disability types.  For example, [[Goalball at the Summer Paralympics|goalball]] is only for visually impaired athletes.  The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or &quot;black out mask&quot; so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goalball|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IOSD_Sports/Goalball/index.html|accessdate=2010-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024104216/http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IOSD_Sports/Goalball/index.html | archivedate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sports, like [[Athletics at the Summer Paralympics|athletics]], are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments. In athletics participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment.  For example: classes 11‚Äì13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletics|publisher=Australian Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/SportProfiles/Athletics.aspx|accessdate=2010-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118115126/http://www.paralympic.org.au/Sport/SportProfiles/Athletics.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are also team competitions such as [[Wheelchair rugby at the Summer Paralympics|wheelchair rugby]].  Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation.  A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby the five players' combined disability number must total no more than eight points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheelchair Rugby|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/IF_Sports/Wheelchair_Rugby/index.html|accessdate=2010-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619180525/http://paralympic.org/Sport/IF_Sports/Wheelchair_Rugby/index.html|archivedate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Paralympic sports}}
There are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and five sports on the Winter Paralympics program.  Within some of the sports are several events.  For example, [[Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics|alpine skiing]] has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom.  The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them.  Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the [[International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation]] (IWAS), the [[International Blind Sports Federation]] (IBSA), and the [[Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Organization/|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005622/http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Organization/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/|accessdate=2010-04-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305234248/http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating at the Paralympic Games}}
After the [[2000 Summer Paralympics|2000 Sydney Games]], a [[Spain at the Paralympic Games|Spanish]] basketball player alleged that several members of the gold-medal winning Spanish basketball intellectually disabled (ID) team were not disabled.  He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an intellectually disabled athlete.&lt;ref name=cheating2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cheating shame of Paralympics|last=Slot|first=Owen|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2001-02-03|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2998162/Cheating-shame-of-Paralympics.html|accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A controversy ensued and the IPC called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2000_11_27_a.html |title=IPC Calls For Full Investigation|accessdate=2010-04-07|date=2000-11-27|publisher=International Paralympic Committee |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060118062536/http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2000_11_27_a.html |archivedate = 2006-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules.  In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martin Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules. The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own.&lt;ref name=cheating2/&gt;  The results of the IPC's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes.&lt;ref name=cheating2/&gt;  As a result, all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2001_03_09_a.html |title=IPC Suspends INAS-FID from Membership|accessdate=2010-04-07|date=2001-03-09|publisher=International Paralympic Committee |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041224162629/http://www.paralympic.org/release/Main_Sections_Menu/Media/Press_Releases/2001_03_09_a.html |archivedate = 2004-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities.

The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use.  At the 2008 Games in Beijing, three powerlifters and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances.&lt;ref name=cheating/&gt;  This was a decrease in comparison to the ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games.&lt;ref name=steroids&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paralympians can do the same thing as Olympic athletes-including cheating|publisher=CNNSI.com|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2002-03-06|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2002/03/06/paralympics_cheating_ap/|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids.

Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of &quot;[[boosting (doping)|boosting]]&quot;.  Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15%.  This is most effective in the endurance sports such as [[Paralympic cross-country skiing|cross-country skiing]].  To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury.  This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly, and using high-pressured compression stockings.  The injury is painless but it does have an impact on the athlete's blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cheating probed at paralympic games|publisher=Canwest Publishing Inc.|work=The Ottawa Citizen|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=2010-03-18|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/2010wintergames/paralympics/cross-country-skiing/Cheating+Probed+Paralympic+Games/2697572/story.html|accessdate=2010-04-14}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential concern is the use of [[gene therapy]] among Paralympic athletes.  All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through [[gene doping]], but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary&quot;&gt;Wolbring, G.

The '''World Mind Sports Games (WMSG)''' is a quadrennial [[multi-sport event]] created by the [[International Mind Sports Association]] (IMSA) as a &quot;stepping stone on the path of introducing a third kind of [[Olympic Games]] (after the Summer and the Winter Olympics)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbridge.org/competitions/worldchampionships/worldbridgegames.asp World Bridge Games]. World Bridge Federation. Retrieved 2011-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural [[2008 World Mind Sports Games]] were held in Beijing from October 3 to 18, about two months after the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] and one month after the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=0xin/&gt;&lt;ref name=0pak/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Five [[mind sports]] participated in the first Games: [[Contract Bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (board game)|go]] (weiqi), and [[xiangqi]] (Chinese chess).&lt;ref name=0fide/&gt;&lt;ref name=0chess/&gt; Thirty-five gold medals were contested by 2,763 competitors from 143 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2008wmsg.org/2008-wmsg-results &quot;2008 WMSG Results&quot;]. 2008WMSG. Retrieved 2011-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second WMSG were held in [[Lille]], [[France]] from August 9 to 23, 2012, starting during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and ending shortly before the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].

==Related events==

In addition to the quadrennial WMSG, the [[International Mind Sports Association]] also organises the [[SportAccord World Mind Games]], whose &quot;first annual&quot; edition was held in Beijing, December 2011. The SportAccord Games have fewer and smaller events with cash prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsaworld.com/site/news_full/22.html &quot;Great Success of the 2011 SportAccord World Mind Games&quot;]. News (no date). IMSA. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

At the first two WMSG events, medals were contested in five different [[mind sports]]: [[Contract Bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (board game)|go]] (weiqi), and [[xiangqi]] (Chinese chess).&lt;ref name=0fide/&gt;&lt;ref name=0chess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsaworld.com/uploads/pdf/Presentation_2012.pdf &quot;2nd World Mind Sports Games: Lille 2012&quot;] (pdf presentation). IMSA. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of Poker]] (IFP) is an observer member of IMSA, so [[poker]] has been mentioned as a possible future sport at the WMSG.

Mathematical games are also planned to be present at 2012 WMSG, in the form of a contest between national teams.

==Continuing competitions==

&lt;!-- The heading may be no good. We should cover the matter of new and continuing championships. If the WBF alone moved established competition here, we need to say that. This is a start. --&gt;
More than half of the 2008 participants were bridge players, partly because the World Bridge Federations transferred some important quadrennial competitions to the WMSG, especially the Open and Women flights of its [[World Team Olympiad]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The third flight, contesting the Senior International Cup, also moved as a non-medal event sharing the same venues.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 there had been in the main continuing events 72 Open and 43 Women &quot;Olympiad&quot; entries (national {{gcb|teams-of-four}} with six players on most squads). Under the Minds Sports rubric in Beijing there were 71 and 54 entries, about 700 players. The one-time, similar tournament with a 28 years age limit attracted another 400 players.

The Games were originally intended to convene sometime after the Summer Olympics (and Paralympics)&lt;!-- do they follow the Summer OG directly? --&gt; in the same city or at least the same country, using some of the same facilities. The inaugural Games did use the Olympic Village in [[Beijing]] about two months after the Olympics and one month after the Paralympics. However, this intention was not carried out in 2012, as [[Lille]] was chosen as host of the WMSG for the year that the Summer Olympics were held in [[London]], [[Great Britain]].

For 2016, the Olympic host [[Brazil]] early on expressed an interest in hosting the third WMSG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsaworld.com/site/news_full/19.html &quot;The Brazilian Mind Sport Association is founded: Brazil becomes a candidate to host the World Mind Sports Games in 2016&quot;]. News (no date). IMSA. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; At the closing ceremony of the 2012 games, [[Rio de Janeiro]] was indeed announced as hosts for the 2016 event,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsaworld.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMSA_bul_14_color.pdf] Retrieved 2012-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not confirmed on later news.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">The '''Outgames''' are a set of series of multi-event sporting competitions for the [[LGBT]] community, which is open to all competitors regardless of sexual orientation, or qualification standard. They are sanctioned by GLISA, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]]. They derived from the original [[2006 World Outgames]], when the Montreal organizing committee split with the  FGG ([[Federation of Gay Games]]) over the organization of the [[2006 Gay Games]], and created their own sanctioning body and series of Games, with the cooperation of the EGLSF ([[European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation]]), the sanctioning body of the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|EuroGames]]. After the creation of the [[World Outgames]], regional Games were created to complement the EuroGames, being the [[North American Outgames]] and the [[AsiaPacific Outgames]]. Outgames editions are accompanied by [[OutFest]] cultural festivals and [[OutRights]] LGBT rights conventions. The first convention at the 2006 World Outgames developed the [[Declaration of Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2007/04/02/outgames-calgary.html|title = Outgames kicked off in Calgary|publisher = CBC News|date = April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgary2007.com/outFest.asp |title=Lily Tomlin's First-ever Calgary Performance |publisher=2007 Outgames |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509004555/http://www.calgary2007.com/outFest.asp |archivedate=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outgames are not to be confused with the [[Gay Games]].

== Gay Games and Outgames Will Not Merge ==

From late in 2009 ‚Äì February 28, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federation Of Gay Games Ends One World Event Talks With GLISA|url=http://eile.ie/2016/03/04/federation-of-gay-games-ends-one-world-event-talks-with-glisa/|publisher=EILE Magazine|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation of Gay Games]] (FGG) host to the Gay Games and the Gay &amp; Lesbian International Sports Association (GLISA) host to the Outgames have held joint meetings to discuss the feasibility of unifying efforts and hosting a single athletic, cultural and human rights event for the LBGT community.  On February 28, 2016 the FGG Board of Directors voted to end further negotiations and discussions with the GLISA. The FGG official statement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Joanie|last2=Dahl|first2=Kurt|title=OFFICIAL STATEMENT FGG Decision regarding the One World Event Partnership|url=https://gaygames.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FGG-1WE-STATEMENT.pdf|website=gaygames|publisher=Federation of Gay Games|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the decision gave hope that the two organizations could work together but stated the organizations would continue to have [https://gaygames.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FGG-1WE-STATEMENT.pdf separate events]. The organizations will not be hosting a unified event in 2022 and both organizations will sponsor separate events as originally scheduled. In the near future, the next competitions are the World Outgames which are being held in Miami in 2017. The 2016 North America Outgames will be held locally in [http://teamsaintlouis.org/index.php/games/2016-north-america-outgames St. Louis]  and in 2018 The Gay Games will be held in [https://www.paris2018.com/ Paris]

The two organizations had another failed attempt to merge.  The prior attempt to hold a One Quadrennial Event (1QE) in 2018 also failed. The most recent attempt to merge the games for 2022 was formalized in May of 2015 with a signed Memo of Understanding.  The FGG and GLISA created the Joint Working Group and tried to create a framework for a combined quadrennial event that would bring together the LGBT community.  Each organization has its own strengths as [[Cyd Zeigler]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zeigler|first1=Cyd|title=Gay Games and Outgames may merge in 2022|url=http://www.outsports.com/2015/3/3/8142661/gay-games-outgames-merge|website=SB Nation|publisher=Outsports|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;has stated. The Gay Games are more competitive and attract more athletes and the Outgames have a positive idea of unity within the community. The failure to unify the games in 2018 and 2022 was due to financial differences. The failure to fully disclose financial information created a lack of trust and increased the risk of combining the events. The event organizers know that the number of athletes and spectators needs to be significantly higher than it is currently projected in order to make the profit they desire. The Outgames have consistently lost money while a study of the Gay Games shows they had a positive financial impact on the host city in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wall|first1=Karen|title=Game Plan: a social history of sport in Alberta|date=2012|page=236|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rohlin|first1=Shawn|title=Economic Impact Study for Gay Games 2014|url=http://www.gg9cle.com/_CE/pagecontent/Documents/Learn%20About%20The%20Games/Economic%20Impact%20Study%20for%20Gay%20Games%202014.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deaflympics''' (previously called ''World Games for the Deaf'', and ''International Games for the Deaf'') are an [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)-sanctioned event at which [[deaf]] athletes compete at an elite level. However, unlike the athletes in other IOC-sanctioned events (i.e., the Olympics, the Paralympics, and the Special Olympics), the Deaflympians cannot be guided by sounds (i.e., the starter's guns, bullhorn commands or referee whistles).&lt;ref name=&quot;deaflympics.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.deaflympics.com/news/ International Committee of Sports for the Deaf ‚Äì News]. Deaflympics.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The games have been organized by the ''[[Comit√© International des Sports des Sourds]]'' (CISS, &quot;The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf&quot;) since [[1924 Summer Deaflympics|the first event]].

== History ==
The Deaflympics are held every four years, and are the longest running multi-sport event excluding the Olympics themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabled-world.com/sports/deaflympics/ What are the Deaflympics?]. Disabled World. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[1924 Summer Deaflympics|The first games, held in Paris in 1924]], were also the first ever international sporting event for athletes with a [[disability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Future Directions&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Future+Directions+of+the+Deaflympics.-a078030429 Future Directions of the Deaflympics]. Thefreelibrary.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been held every four years since, apart from a break for World War II, and an additional event, the Deaflympic Winter Games, was added in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical overview&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Historical+overview+of+the+Paralympics,+Special+Olympics,+and...-a0114366604 Historical overview of the Paralympics, Special Olympics, and Deaflympics]. Thefreelibrary.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The games began as a small gathering of 148 athletes from nine European nations competing in the International Silent Games in Paris, France, in 1924; now, they have grown into a global movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;deaflympics.com&quot;/&gt;

Officially, the games were originally called the &quot;International Games for the Deaf&quot; from 1924 to 1965, but were sometimes referred to as the &quot;International Silent Games&quot;. From 1966 to 1999 they were called the &quot;World Games for the Deaf&quot;, and occasionally referred to as the &quot;World Silent Games&quot;. From 2001, the games have been known by their current name Deaflympics (often mistakenly called the Deaf Olympics).&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical overview&quot;/&gt;

To qualify for the games, athletes must have a [[hearing loss]] of at least 55 db in their &quot;better ear&quot;. [[Hearing aids]], [[cochlear implants]] and the like are not allowed to be used in competition, to place all athletes on the same level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical overview&quot;/&gt; Other examples of ways the games vary from hearing competitions are the manner in which they are officiated. To address the issue of Deaflympians not being able to be guided by sounds, certain sports use alternative methods of commencing the game. For example, the football referees wave a flag instead of blowing a whistle; on the track, races are started by using a light, instead of a starter pistol. It is also customary for spectators not to cheer or clap, but rather to wave ‚Äì usually with both hands.

'''International Workers' Olympiads''' were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SASI). It was an organisation supported by [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties and [[International Federation of Trade Unions]]. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the [[Olympic Games]]. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2012/08/01/workers-olympics |title= A workers' Olympics? |publisher= Workers' Liberty |date=1 August 2012 | language = |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Opening march 1931 Vienna.JPG|thumb|Opening march of the 1931 Workers' Olympiad in Vienna.]]
The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]] and [[Avery Brundage]], were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace.&lt;ref name=riordan&gt;Riordan, James: ‚Ä≥Sport, Politics, and Communism‚Ä≥, p. 38‚Äì40. Manchester University Press, 1991. ISBN 978-071-90285-0-2. [https://books.google.fi/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=1921+olympiad+prague&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmua0exF57&amp;sig=OYtYQPyvi6_UKl2nqH2hz3z6wpk&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m9BjVaTNFYqesAHd0YHQBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucerne Sport International]] (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. The IOC had banned the losing side of the [[World War I]] from the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the &quot;enemy&quot; side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schreiberhau]], which today is a part of [[Poland]]. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name=riordan/&gt; 

National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.helsinki.fi/shentila/files/2005/04/TUL_ja-kansainv%C3%A4linen.pdf Hentil√§, Seppo: ‚Ä≥Ty√∂v√§en Urheiluliitto ja kansainv√§linen ty√∂l√§isurheilu‚Ä≥] (in Finnish). University of Helsinki. Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad]] in [[Vienna]] was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] at [[Los Angeles]], both in number of participants as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm Roni Gechtman: &quot;Socialist Sports in Yiddish ‚Äì The Bundist Sport Organization Morgnshtern in Interwar Poland&quot;.] Retrieved 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praterstadion]] (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/sportamt/annodazumal/sportstaetten/stadion.html |title= Wiener Praterstadion - Ernst-Happel-Stadion - Historische Sportst√§tte der Stadt Wien |publisher= City of Vienna |date= | language = German|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Workers' Olympiad at [[Antwerp]] in 1937 was a joint event with the [[Red Sport International]] organized [[Spartakiads]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish (ed.): &quot;Sports Around the World ‚Äì History, Culture and Practice&quot; (p. 463).

{{commonscat|World Firefighters Games}}

The '''World Firefighter Games''' is an International sporting event that welcomes all full-time part-time, Structural Firefighters, Bush fire firefighters &amp; Volunteer firefighters,  Aviation Fire Services. Military Emergency Response personnel and their immediate direct family from all across the globe.

The Games are held biennially in different countries around the world and offer over 50 different sports including sports such as: [[Archery]], [[Rugby Sevens]], [[Windsurfing]], [[Poker]], Swimming, Athletics, Softball, Poker to name a few with the &quot;Toughest FireFighter Alive&quot; being the blue riband event.

==History==
The concept began in 1988 with the first ever World Firefighters Games held in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] from 22 to 29 April 1990, with 1800 Athletes and 1400 Supporters coming from 17 different countries, the first Games were a huge success.

The purpose of the games was to introduce the four following concepts within the services:

#  To promote health and fitness
#  To provide a forum for information exchange between Fire Services
#  To foster comradeship amongst firefighters
#  To encourage family participation

The motivation behind the games was to overcome some of the problems with entering the [[World Police and Fire Games]], in that the games are only open to full-time paid firefighters. As most fire services globally use mostly [[Volunteer Fire Department|volunteer personnel]] the World Firefighters Games allows entrants that are full-time, part-time and volunteer, as well as the families of fire service personnel to enter.

After the first Games companies registered their business interests in the concept in an attempt to make a profit from the games by registering the names etc. However when the Games were held in Perth, Western Australia in 1994 the organising committee felt so strongly about the Games belonging to the firefighters, and not to take away from the original concept of the Games, that they bought the rights from the original owners and Perth has now become the home of the World Governing Body, &quot;World Firefighters Games WA Inc&quot;. The World Governing Body for the World Firefighters Games licenses each fire department and allows use of the name etc. for the running of the event, the governing body is entirely a Non-Profit Organization and all proceeds are donated to charity.

The Largest Games were held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], USA from 16‚Äì22 May 1992 with approximately 4,000 athletes and 14,000 supporters and spectators.

LA 2014 was cancelled by the &quot;proprietor&quot;{{who?|date=November 2015}} of the games sometime during the week of 19 May 2014.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The 2016 Games Host will be announced as soon as possible, these games will be run under the auspices of World Firefighters Games WA Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Firefighters Games|url=[http://worldfirefightersgames.com/]|publisher=World Firefighters Games Western Australia Inc|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13208">The '''Island Games''' (currently known as the '''NatWest Island Games''' for sponsorship reasons) are an international multi-sports event organised by the [[International Island Games Association]]. The [[2015 Island Games|most recent games]] were held in [[Jersey]] (except the gymnastics, which were held on a different island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jersey2015.com/|title=NatWest Island Games XVI - Jersey 2015|publisher=Jersey2015.com - Island Games|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from 27 June to 3 July 2015, with around 3000 competitors from 24 competing islands or island groups competing in 14 sports.

== History ==
The Island Games began in 1985 as the ''Inter-Island Games'', as part of the [[Isle of Man]] International Year of Sport, and were intended to be a one-off sporting celebration only. Geoffrey Corlett, who became the first Games Director, not only contacted the islands surrounding the [[United Kingdom]], but also encouraged the countries of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]], the territories of [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Saint Helena]], the [[Channel Islands]] and others to participate. Initially, fifteen islands with 600 competitors and officials took part in seven sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiga.org/games_profile_11997.html|title=Inaugural Inter-Island Games - Isle of Man 1985|work=iiga.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the total cost of staging the Games being put at [[Pound sterling|&amp;#163;]]70,000. The [[track and field]] events were held on an eight-lane grass track, a far cry from the current games, which now use synthetic tracks in stadiums capable of holding thousands of spectators. The Games of 1985 were so successful that organisers decided to hold a similar event two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jersey2015.com/the-games|title=The Games|publisher=Jersey2015.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the Maccabiah was held every three years; since the [[4th Maccabiah]], the event is held the year following the Olympic Games. In contrast with other large multi-sport events such as the [[Olympics]], competitions at the Maccabiah are organized into four distinct divisions ‚Äì Juniors, Open, Masters, and Disabled.&lt;ref name=world364 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leah Levey Set to Compete at Maccabiah Games in Israel Next Month|url=http://athletics.case.edu/sports/wsoc/2013-14/releases/20130621989jlj|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|accessdate=February 16, 2014|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Maccabiah'' was chosen after [[Judah Maccabee]], a Jewish leader that defended his country from king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit of Judah Maccabee strides into the present day|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/hanukkah/maccabiah.games/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014|date=December 24, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modi'in]], Judah's birthplace is also the starting location of the torch that's used to light the flames at the opening ceremony, a tradition that started at the [[4th Maccabiah]].&lt;ref name=bard /&gt;

==History==
[[File:1st Maccabiah.jpg|thumb|First Maccabiah Games]]
{{main|History of the Maccabiah}}
The Maccabiah games were the result of a proposal put forward by [[Yosef Yekutieli]] in 1929 at the ''Maccabi World Congress''. Yekutieli, who heard about the [[Stockholm Olympics]], wanted to form a representation for [[Eretz Yisrael]]. Following the appointment of the new [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|British Palestine High Commissioner]], Sir [[Arthur Grenfell Wauchope]], the Maccabiah got the go-ahead. The [[1st Maccabiah]] opened on March 28, 1932.&lt;ref name=mendel31&gt;Mendelsohn p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maccabiah Stadium]] in [[Tel Aviv]], which was built with donations was filled to capacity. Roughly 400 athletes took part from 18 countries in everything from swimming, football, and handball, to various athletics. In the first games, the Polish delegation took first place.&lt;ref name=mendel31 /&gt;

Following the success of the first games, the [[2nd Maccabiah]] was held from April 2 to 10, 1935 despite official opposition by the British Mandatory government. Over 1,300 athletes from 28 nations participated. The [[3rd Maccabiah]] which was originally scheduled for spring of 1938&lt;ref name=bard /&gt; were postponed until 1950 due to British concerns of large-scale illegal immigration,&lt;ref name=bard /&gt; [[World War II]], and the [[Israeli Independence War|Independence War]].&lt;ref&gt;Nauright, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first Maccabiah to be held after the establishment of the [[State of Israel]].

[[File:1st Maccabiah, Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|left|Delegations in the streets of [[Tel Aviv]] during the parade of the 1st Maccabiah.]]
Starting from the [[4th Maccabiah]], the games were changed to take place every four years on the year following the [[Olympics]]. The [[15th Maccabiah|15th edition]] was marred by what became known as the [[Maccabiah bridge collapse|Maccabiah bridge disaster]] when a temporary bridge built for the march of athletes at the opening ceremony collapsed, plunging about 100 members of the Australian delegation into the polluted waters of [[Yarkon River]]. Four athletes were killed and 63 injured.&lt;ref&gt;Nauright, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bard85&gt;Bard and Schwartz, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 5,000 participants from over fifty countries competed in those games.&lt;ref name=bard85 /&gt;

Over the last two decades, the number of participants have grown to 7,700 in the [[17th Maccabiah]]. The most recent Maccabiah, the [[19th Maccabiah]], brought together 9000 athletes from 78 countries, making it the 3rd largest sporting event in the world and the largest sporting event in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;huff2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinai |first=Allon |url=http://www.jpost.com/Sports/WATCH-LIVE-The-opening-ceremony-of-19th-Maccabiah-Games-2013-320291 |title=The opening ceremony of 19th Maccabiah Games 2013 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winter Maccabiah ===
{{main|1933 Maccabiah Games|1936 Maccabiah Games}}
Prior to [[World War II]] there was an attempt to organize a winter Maccabiah. Due to the relatively warm temperatures in Palestine, the winter Maccabiot were organized in European nations. The [[1st Winter Maccabiah]] was held in [[Zakopane]], [[Poland]] February 2 to 5, 1933.&lt;ref name=mendel26&gt;Mendelsohn p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanak1&gt;Hanak. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The games were met with great opposition; the [[Gazeta Warszawska]] newspaper encouraged Polish youth to intervene during the games to prevent the &quot;Jewification of Polish winter sports venues&quot;.&lt;ref name=mendel26 /&gt; A second attempt at the winter games was relatively more successful. The [[2nd Winter Maccabiah]] took place February 18 to 22, 1936 in [[Bansk√° Bystrica]], (then [[Czechoslovakia]]).&lt;ref name=Hanak1 /&gt; In the games, 2,000 athletes from 12 nations participated.&lt;ref&gt;Hanak. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austria Wins Skiing Event in Winter Maccabiah|url=http://www.jta.org/1936/02/21/archive/austria-wins-skiing-event-in-winter-maccabiah|accessdate=February 22, 2014|newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=February 21, 1936|author=Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time a winter Maccabiah was ever held and the only two Maccabiot to not take place in the [[Land of Israel]]; although [[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] still runs smaller regional winter games to date.

== Ceremonies ==
The '''Maccabiah ceremony''' are two ceremonial events that take place during the first and last days of the [[Maccabiah]] games. The ceremonies are an important part of the [[Jewish culture]] in Israel and the [[Zionist movement]]. The ceremonies of the Maccabiah can trace their roots to the early Olympics games of the 20th century. As such, they share many similarities.

The Maccabiah opening ceremony, which are organized by the [[Maccabi World Union]], have recently been presented in [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

=== Opening ===

The opening ceremonies represent the official commencement of the Maccabiah. Some sports however, such as Golf and Rugby, might start prior to the opening ceremonies in order to finish on time. The opening ceremony for the first games were held at the new [[Maccabiah Stadium]]. The [[Maccabiah Stadium]] which is located next to the [[Yarkon River]] in [[Tel Aviv]] was finished just the night before. The Stadium also hosted the 2nd Maccabiah in 1935. For the [[1950 Maccabiah Games|3rd Maccabiah]], the opening ceremony took place in a new [[Ramat Gan Stadium|stadium in Ramat Gan]]. The stadium has been hosting the opening ceremonies of the Maccaibah ever since with the exception of the [[16th Maccabiah|16th]] and [[19th Maccabiah|19th]] Maccabiah games which were held in [[Teddy Stadium]], [[Jerusalem]].

The ceremonies often start with the introduction of the active participants of the [[Maccabi youth movement]]. After the parade of nations the opening ceremony continues on with a presentation of artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of the Jewish culture. In recent games, Jewish singers from around the world were invited to participate in the opening ceremony. For example, in 2013, Grammy Award-winner [[Miri Ben-Ari]] and X-Factor USA finalist [[Carly Rose Sonenclar]] performed at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the Maccabiah Opening Ceremonies|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/blog/watch-the-maccabiah-opening-ceremonies|work=July 18, 2013|publisher=[[The Jewish Exponent]]|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parade of Nations ====
{{see also|Olympic Games ceremony#Parade of Nations|l1=Parade of Nations at the Olympic Games}}
Just like at the Olympics, the Maccabiah starts out with a &quot;Parade of Nations&quot;, during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. The countries enter the stadium in accordance with the [[Hebrew Alphabet]]. The parade of nations, in contrast to some other games, include junior and disabled athletes who also partake in the competitions. In accordance with the Maccabiah's tradition, the Israeli delegation always enters last.

=== Closing ===
The closing ceremony of Maccabiah Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Typically, a member of Maccabi or some other well known figure make their closing speech and the Games officially close. The ceremony includes large artistic displays of music, singing, dance. Various Jewish singers perform during the closing ceremony. In recent years, the closing ceremonies included popular musicians in live music and dancing.

=== Medal presentation ===
A medal ceremony is held after each Maccabiah event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. Medals are awarded by an official Maccabi member.

== Sports ==

{{main|Maccabiah sports}}
The Maccabiah games recognizes all 28 current Olympic sports, plus many other sports such as [[chess]], [[cricket]] and [[netball]]. In contrast with the [[Olympic games]] and other major international sporting events, the Maccabiah rules regarding accepting new sports are very lenient. New sports are accepted to the Maccabiah Games provided that competitions will only take place if four separate delegations bring competitors for that sport. (three in the case of female sports as well as the junior divisions)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maccabiah17.com/Images/Links/Basic%20Rules%20.pdf 17th Maccabiah Basic Regulations] {{wayback|url=http://www.maccabiah17.com/Images/Links/Basic%20Rules%20.pdf |date=20070927023144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Maccabiah has held various unique competitions such as [[duplicate bridge]]. Karate, not yet on the Olympic schedule, made its debut in 1977 at the 10th Maccabiah Games. Largely due to the efforts of American karate sensei, Alex Sternberg, the requisite number of initial countries signed on and agreed to send a delegation. Since 1977, karate has participated uninterrupted. Although, at the beginning, karate was only contested in the fighting or kumite category, forms or kata was included in 1981.  In 1985, womens karate was added. Junior and youth categories made their debut in 2009. The World Karate Federation, a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) oversees and supervises the rules of karate competition at the Maccabiah.

The Maccabiah games are organized into four distinct divisions: Open, Junior, Masters, and Paralympics.
* Junior games ‚Äì The Junior Maccabiah games are open to any qualifying athlete aged 15‚Äì18.
* Masters games ‚Äì The masters games are designed to accommodate older competitors; these games are divided into a number of different age categories
* Open games ‚Äì The open games are generally unlimited in age and are intended for the best athletes from each delegation, bound by the governing international rules in each sport
* Paralympic games ‚Äì The paralympic games are generally open to all athletes with a range of physical and intellectual disabilities. Past games included [[Para-cycling classification|Para-cycling]], [[Paralympic swimming]], [[Para table tennis]], [[Half Marathon]], and [[Wheelchair Basketball]].

In recent Maccabiot there has been a renewed interest to introduce new sports to the Maccabiah. In the [[15th Maccabiah]] games [[Ice hockey]] was first introduced. Ice hockey was not included in subsequent games but returned in the [[19th Maccabiah]]. Squash became an official sport in the [[10th Maccabiah]] Games in 1977. The 19th Maccabiah was also granted provisional approval for [[dressage]] and [[Show jumping|jumping]] competitions from the [[International Equestrian Federation|FEI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FEI Grants Approval for Horse Sports at Maccabiah Games|url=http://www.dressage-news.com/?p=20003|accessdate=February 20, 2014|date=March 2, 2013|newspaper=Dressage News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Summer and Winter Olympic Games.svg|thumbnail|Visualization of the Olympic Games]]
The modern '''Olympic Games''' or '''Olympics''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux olympiques}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/fr/|title=Jeux Olympiques - Sports, Athl√®tes, M√©dailles, Rio 2016|work=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of [[athletes]] from around the world participate in a [[multi-sport event|variety of competitions]]. The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; The Olympic Games are held every [[Olympiad|four years]], with the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Their creation was inspired by the [[ancient Olympic Games]], which were held in [[Olympia, Greece]], from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] founded the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the [[Olympic Movement]], with the [[Olympic Charter]] defining its structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] for ice and winter sports, the [[Paralympic Games]] for athletes with a disability, and the [[Youth Olympic Games]] for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the [[Cold War]] limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.

The Olympic Movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic program, consisting of the [[Olympic sports|sports]] to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the [[Olympic flag]] and [[Olympic Flame#Torches|torch]], as well as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]]. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive [[Olympic medal]]s: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.

The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies|controversies]], including boycotts, [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games|doping]], bribery, and a [[Munich massacre|terrorist attack in 1972]]. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

==Ancient Olympics==
{{main|Ancient Olympic Games}}
[[File:Olympia-stadion.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium in [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece]]. Competition was among representatives of several [[city-state]]s and kingdoms of [[Ancient Greece]]. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the [[pankration]], horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.{{r|Swaddling 2000 p54}} This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Truce ‚Äì Myth and Reality by Harvey Abrams|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/abrams1.html|publisher=Classics Technology Center, AbleMedia.com|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;{{sfn|Young|2004|p=12}} one of the most popular myths identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;elis1-7-9&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|1992|p=227}}{{sfn|Young|2004|pp=12‚Äì13}} According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games &quot;Olympic&quot; and established the custom of holding them every four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;elis1-7-7&quot; /&gt; The myth continues that after Heracles completed his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labors]], he built the [[Olympic Stadium]] as an honor to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a &quot;[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]&quot; ({{lang-el|œÉœÑŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ}}, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', &quot;stage&quot;), which later became a [[Stadion (unit of length)|unit of distance]]. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776&amp;nbsp;BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|registration=yes|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, [[Discus throw|discus]] and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, [[pankration]], and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] events.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|pp=59‚Äì61}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition has it that [[Coroebus of Elis|Coroebus]], a cook from the city of [[Elis]], was the first Olympic champion.{{sfn|Golden|2009|p=24}}

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|famous statue]] by [[Phidias]] stood in his temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King [[Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisatis]].{{sfn|Burkert|1983|p=95}} The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.{{sfn|Swaddling|1999|pp=90‚Äì93}} The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an [[Olympiad]], was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the [[Panhellenic Games]], which included the [[Pythian Games]], the [[Nemean Games]], and the [[Isthmian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Olympic Museum, &quot;The Olympic Games in Antiquity&quot;, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic Games reached their [[zenith]] in the 6th and 5th&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393&amp;nbsp;AD, when the emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia {{harv|Crowther|2007|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another date commonly cited is 426&amp;nbsp;AD, when his successor, [[Theodosius II]], ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|p=54}}

==Modern Games==

===Forerunners===
[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]

Various uses of the term &quot;Olympic&quot; to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the [[Cotswold Games]] or &quot;Cotswold Olimpick Games&quot;, an annual meeting near [[Chipping Campden]], England, involving various sports. It was first organized by the lawyer [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]] between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The [[British Olympic Association]], in its bid for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] in London, mentioned these games as &quot;the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings&quot;.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Olympiade de la R√©publique'', a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;frencholympics&quot; /&gt; The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the [[metric system]] into sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;frencholympics&quot; /&gt;

In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]] at [[Much Wenlock]], in [[Shropshire]], England. In 1859, Dr. Brookes changed the name to the [[Wenlock Olympian Games]]. This annual sports festival continues to this day.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=144}} The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr. Brookes on 15 November 1860.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=28}}

Between 1862 and 1867, [[Liverpool]] held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and [[Charles Melly]], these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=53‚Äì54}}{{sfn|Weiler|2004}} The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.{{r|Girginov Parry 2005 p38}} In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the [[British Olympic Association]]. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the [[Olympic Charter|International Olympic Charter]].{{sfn|Young|1996|p=24}} In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized at London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml |title= Much Wenlock &amp; the Olympian Connection |publisher= Wenlock Olympian Society |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123183803/http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate= 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
[[File:Stamp of Greece. 1896 Olympic Games. 2l.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A postage stamp from the first Greek Olympic stamp set.]]

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor [[Panagiotis Soutsos]] in his poem &quot;Dialogue of the Dead&quot;, published in 1833.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=1}} [[Evangelos Zappas]], a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to [[King Otto of Greece]], in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}} Zappas sponsored the first [[Zappas Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1859, which was held in an [[Athens]] city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [[Panathenaic Stadium]] so that it could host all future Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}}

The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=2, 13‚Äì23, 81}} Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=44}} In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the [[Wenlock Olympian Society]], Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] was inspired to found the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref name=&quot;wenlock&quot; /&gt; Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;wenlock&quot; /&gt; He presented these ideas during the first [[Olympic Congress]] of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the [[University of Paris]]. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.{{sfn|Coubertin|Philemon|Politis|Anninos|1897|p=8|loc=Part 2}} The IOC elected the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=100‚Äì105}}

===1896 Games===
{{main|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening ceremony in the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]].]]

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappas and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa ‚Äì Athens 1893, by F. Martens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'affaire Zappa ‚Äì Paris 1894, by G. Streit&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Averoff]] contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}} The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}}

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes and adaptations===
{{main|Summer Olympic Games}}

After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition in 1900]] and the [[World's fair]] at St. Louis in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] were side shows. The Games in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]]. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 ‚Äì Overview |publisher= ESPN |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third [[Olympiad]]) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title=1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080731211554/http://www.cbc.ca:80/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |archivedate=31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Winter Games====
{{main|Winter Olympic Games}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|upright=0.93|thumb|left|An [[ice hockey]] game during the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] at [[St. Moritz]].]]

The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]] in [[Lausanne]], it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11&amp;nbsp;days) was held in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, in connection with the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] held three months later; this event became the first [[Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chamonix&quot; /&gt; Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title= Winter Olympics History |publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation |accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

====Paralympics====
{{main|Paralympic Games}}

[[File:031164 - Tokyo opening ceremony -7 - 1a - adjusted.jpg|thumb|[[1964 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Tokyo]].]]
In 1948, [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]], determined to promote the rehabitation of soldiers after [[World War II]], organized a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttmann's event, known then as the [[IWAS World Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]], in Rome, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the &quot;Parallel Olympics&quot;, which became known as the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2 February 2009 | date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parahist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Chairman of the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games|London organising committee]], [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]], said about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in London that,

====Youth Games====
{{main|Youth Olympic Games}}

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogge introduces&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rice |first= John |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm |title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= USA Today |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|first Summer Youth Games]] were held in Singapore from 14‚Äì26 August 2010, while the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|inaugural Winter Games]] were hosted in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innsbruck is the host city for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|date=12 December 2008|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/61888/32574/1t8ch2t/innsbruck-is-the-host-city-for.html|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIonYOG&quot; /&gt; The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;YOGisGo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No kidding&quot; /&gt; The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2007-07-05-olympic-notes_N.htm |title= IOC votes to start Youth Olympics in 2010 |first= Vicky |last= Michaelis |date= 5 July 2007 |work= USA Today |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st-century games===
From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/london-2012-summer-olympics|title=London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, [[Sochi]] hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the [[Olympic Village]]. This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and [[Hong Kong]], all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070003/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2009|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nation which qualify as &quot;an independent State recognized by the international community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|url=http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&amp;file=Olympic-Charter.ask&amp;query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&amp;search=yes|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Cura√ßao]] when they gained the same constitutional status as [[Aruba]] in 2010, although the IOC had recognized the [[Aruban Olympic Committee]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/executive-board-concludes-first-meeting-of-the-new-year/112731|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|title=Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year|publisher=olympic.org (&quot;Official website of the Olympic movement&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-jose-perurena?articleid=133159|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|work=Olympic.org|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2012, Netherlands Antilles athletes can choose to represent either the [[Netherlands]] or [[Aruba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/media-resources?articleid=132830|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=23 August 2012 |title=Working meeting between the IOC and the NOCs of the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba and the Netherlands|publisher=olympic.org (&quot;Official website of the Olympic movement&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and social impact on host cities and countries===
Many economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such &quot;mega-events&quot; often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A. K., &amp; Spiegel, M. M. (2011). The Olympic Effect*. ''The Economic Journal,'' 121(553), 652‚Äì677.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern philanthropy|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. &quot;Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.&quot; ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111‚Äì148.].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the [[Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions]] reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, M. A. (2008). &quot;Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community.&quot; ''Journal of Management Studies'', 45(6), 1117‚Äì1146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]] were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/economic-impact-winter-olympics-not-great-russia-sochi-stands-gain-1554153|title=The Economic Impact Of The Winter Olympics: Not Great For Russia But Sochi Stands To Gain|date=8 February 2014|agency=International Business Times|work=ibtimes.com|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by December 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Sochi &quot;now feels like a ghost town&quot;, citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas, the still-unfinished construction, and the overall effects Russia's political and economic turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/17/sochi-olympics-legacy-city-feels-like-a-ghost-town|title=The Economic Impact Of The Winter Olympics: Not Great For Russia But Sochi Stands To Gain|date=17 December 2014|agency=The Guardian|work=theguardian.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at least four cities withdrew their bids for the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], citing the costs to host the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/|title=Why Nobody Wants to Host the 2022 Winter Olympics|date=3 October 2014|agency=Time (magazine)|work=time.com|accessdate=10 January 2014|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Olympic Committee==
{{main|International Olympic Committee}}
[[File:Siege cio.jpg|thumb|The I.O.C. headquarters at [[Lausanne]].]]

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations, recognized media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;movement&quot; /&gt; As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;movement roles&quot; /&gt;

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football ([[FIFA]]) is the IF for Association football (soccer), and the [[F√©d√©ration Internationale de Volleyball]] is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=For the Good of the Athletes|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=31 October 2007|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the NOC of the United States. There are currently 205 NOCs recognized by the IOC.&lt;ref name=&quot;iocfactsheet&quot; /&gt;
* Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organization of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/ioc-governance-organising-committees|title=Organising Committees for the Olympic Games |publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=53|loc=Rule 24}}

===Criticism===
The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members on the committee for life. The presidential terms of [[Avery Brundage]] and [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising.{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=52‚Äì60}} He was accused of both racism, for his handling of the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] issue with the [[South Africa at the Olympics|South African]] delegation, and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=60‚Äì69}} Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post |publisher=CBC Sports |date=18 May 2001 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html |accessdate=4 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081205190231/http://www.cbc.ca:80/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html |archivedate=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch's ties with the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain were also a source of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=30 June 1992|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, it was uncovered that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from members of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid committee for the hosting of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=6 December 2003|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buying the Games&quot; /&gt; The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lynn|last=Zinser|title=London Wins 2012 Olympics New York Lags|work=The New York Times|date=7 July 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/sports/othersports/07olympic.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of mayors of Paris|Parisian mayor]] [[Bertrand Delano√´]] specifically accused the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion [[Sebastian Coe]]) of breaking the bid rules.

The [[Turin]] [[Bids for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid]] for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, [[Marc Hodler]], strongly connected with the rival bid of [[Sion, Switzerland]], alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=7 February 2006|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics, &quot;a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Committee's Refusal to Honor Munich 11 Mired in 'Stubborn Insensitivity and Callousness'|url=http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|publisher=ADL|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
{{see also|Cost of the Olympic Games}}

=== Under national organizing committees ===
The Olympics have been commercialized to various degrees since the initial [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertizing,&lt;ref name=&quot;IOC2011Marketing&quot;&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Marketing/OLYMPIC_MARKETING_FACT_FILE_2011.pdf Marketing Fact File, International Olympic Committee, 2011 edition, page 18, accessed 2015-12-22]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kodak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kodak-olympics-idUSWEN164520071012|title=Kodak to end Olympics sponsorship after 2008 games|author=Reuters Editorial|date=12 October 2007|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disruptiveinnovation.se/?p=112|title=No more Kodak moments in the Olympics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]], Odol mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2015-12-04/wildly-interesting-facts-you-never-knew-about-london-until-now/|title=Wildly interesting facts about London you never knew, until now|work=ITV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxo.co.uk/about-us|title=OXO - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formandsurface.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/odol_6830.html|title=FORM AND SURFACE: Odol|author=Alex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coca Cola]] sponsored of the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], and has subsequently remained a sponsor to the current time.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOC2011Marketing&quot; /&gt;

Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, national organizing committees were responsible for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and the use of the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}}

=== Under IOC control ===
The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Under the leadership of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;

===Budget===
During the first half of the 20th century the [[IOC]] ran on a small budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&amp;nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}}

The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organizing committee, led by [[Peter Ueberroth]], was able to generate a surplus of US$225&amp;nbsp;million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt; Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50&amp;nbsp;million for a four-year membership.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the [[Olympic rings|interlocking rings]], in their publications and advertisements.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}}

===Effect of television===
[[File:Olympic Final 2000 (1936 cartoon).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A cartoon from the 1936 Berlin Olympics imagines the year 2000 when spectators will have been replaced by television and radio, their cheers coming from loudspeakers.]]

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822100804/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822213008/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1956|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1960 Winter Olympics|following Winter Games]] had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks‚Äî[[CBS]] paid US$394,000 for the American rights,{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) allocated US$660,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt; In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} For example, CBS paid US$375&amp;nbsp;million for the rights of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Games]],{{sfn|Gershon|2000|p=17}} while [[NBC]] spent US$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;television&quot; /&gt;

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of [[color television]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular in A. Tomlinson &amp; G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30‚Äì43). London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt; Global audience estimates for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Games]] was 600&amp;nbsp;million, whereas at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Games of 1984]], the audience numbers had increased to 900&amp;nbsp;million; that number swelled to 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion by the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2005|p=14}} However, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=4 May 2009 | date=27 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|date=2 October 2000|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429222810/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot; /&gt; With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=16‚Äì18}} The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} Finally, the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=230}} The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Olympics 2012 Ratings: Most Watched Event In TV History|date=13 August 2012|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/london-olympics-2012-ratings-most-watched-ever_n_1774032.html|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=194‚Äì195}} Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-06bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''The Olympic Effect'', March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
{{main|Olympic symbols}}
[[File:Olympic-flag-Victoria.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic flag]].]]

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the [[Olympic rings]], consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents ([[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], [[Europe]]). The colored version of the rings‚Äîblue, yellow, black, green, and red‚Äîover a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;

The [[Olympic motto]], ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', a [[Latin]] expression meaning &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger&quot; was proposed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1894 and has been official since 1924. The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Henri Didon]] OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sport athl√©tique&quot;, 14 mars 1891: &quot;[...] dans une √©loquente allocution il a souhait√© que ce drapeau les conduise 'souvent √† la victoire, √† la lutte toujours'. Il a dit qu‚Äôil leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d‚Äô√™tre des sports athl√©tiques: citius, altius, fortius, 'plus vite, plus haut, plus fort'.&quot;, cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carri√®re du p√®re Didon, Dominicain. 1840 ‚Äì 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Universit√© de Paris IV ‚Äì Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements p√©dagogiques de la devise olympique &quot;citius, altius, fortius&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the [[Olympic creed]]:

{{quote
| The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;
}}

Months before each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;torch&quot; /&gt; Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the torch relay was only introduced at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;olympicsymbols&quot; /&gt;

The [[List of Olympic mascots|Olympic mascot]], an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], when the Russian bear cub [[Misha]] reached international stardom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1279748/Londons-Olympic-2012-mascots-revealed-Wenlock-Mandeville-unveiled-faces-Games.html|title=London's Olympic 2012 mascots are revealed: Wenlock and Mandeville unveiled as the 'faces' of the Games|date=23 May 2010|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]]. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Summer Games Mascots from Munich 1972 to London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.olympic.org/assets/osc%20section/pdf/qr_3e.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
{{main|Olympic Games ceremony}}

===Opening===
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (15).jpg|thumb|A scene from the opening ceremony of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]].]]

As mandated by the [[Olympic Charter]], various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt; Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol1&quot; /&gt; The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt; The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCprotocol1&quot; /&gt; The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&amp;nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080906200510/http://www.cbc.ca:80/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |archivedate=6 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in [[Athens|Athens, Greece]], the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCFactSheetW&quot; /&gt;

===Closing===
[[File:Birdsclosing.jpg|thumb|left|Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].]]

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing Ceremony Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=5 June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Closing_Ceremony_of_the_Games.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;/&gt; The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Closing Ceremony |publisher= International Olympic Committee |date= 31 January 2002 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5gKmkOYeD |archivedate= 26 April 2009 |format= PDF |accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/38344/32574/w6rlej/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem.html |title=The Olympic Flags and Emblem |publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCclosingProtocol&quot;/&gt;

As is customary, the men's marathon medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50&amp;nbsp;km cross-country skiing freestyle mass start medals (at the Winter Olympics) are presented as part of the Closing Ceremony, which take place later that day, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.

===Medal presentation===
[[File:CyclingTeamPursuitBeijing2008.jpg|thumb|A medal ceremony with the [[Danish flag]], the [[Union Jack]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[New Zealand flag]] from left to right during the 2008 Summer Olympics.]]

A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Olympic Games ‚Äì the Medal Ceremonies |work= Encyclop√¶dia Britannica |registration=yes|url= http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games |accessdate=29 August 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the medals are given out by an IOC member, the national flags of the three medalists are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;otraditions&quot; /&gt; Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Medal Ceremony Hostess Outfits Revealed |work= China Daily |date= 18 July 2008 |url= http://english.sina.com/china/p/1/2008/0718/172118.html |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is customary, the men's marathon medals are presented as part of the Summer Closing Ceremony, which take place later that day, in the Olympic Stadium - thus, they are the final medal presentation of the Games.

==Sports==
{{main|Olympic sports}}

The [[Olympic sports|Olympic Games program]] consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestling|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports&quot; /&gt; [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|artistic gymnastics]] are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program. [[Cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics|Cross-country skiing]], [[Figure skating at the Olympic Games|figure skating]], [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]], [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]], [[Ski jumping at the Winter Olympics|ski jumping]], and [[Speed skating at the Winter Olympics|speed skating]] have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Current Olympic sports, like [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]], and [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball]], first appeared on the program as [[demonstration sport]]s, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic sports are governed by [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|pp=88‚Äì90}} There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=87}} During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094118/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing.&lt;ref name=&quot;recognizedsports&quot; /&gt;

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newosports&quot; /&gt;

The 114th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]], in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; Three years later, at the [[117th IOC Session]], the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|softball]] from the official program of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]]. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program featured just 26 sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheetsports&quot; /&gt; The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;newosports&quot; /&gt;

===Amateurism and professionalism===
{{further|Amateur sports}}
[[File:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|left|Professional [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players were allowed to participate in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]] starting in 1998 (''1998 Gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic pictured'').]]

The [[ethos]] of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120‚Äì123}} The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'', a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120‚Äì123}} Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120‚Äì123}}

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/garmisch-partenkirchen-1936-winter-olympics |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120‚Äì123}} The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses ‚Äì from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit√© International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amateurism&quot; /&gt; As of 2012, the only sports in which no professionals compete is [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]], although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers and wrestlers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees.

==Controversies==

===Boycotts===
[[File:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the countries that boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] (yellow), [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] (blue), and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] (red) Summer Olympics.]]

Greece, Australia, France, Great Britain, and Switzerland are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The [[Olympic Council of Ireland]] boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]], because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the [[Irish Free State]] rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.{{r|Kr√ºger Murray 2003 p230}}

There were three boycotts of the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]: the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the [[Suez Crisis]]; and China (the &quot;People's Republic of China&quot;) boycotted the Games because Taiwan was allowed to compete in the Games as the &quot;Republic of China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boycott 1&quot; /&gt;

In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their [[racial segregation|segregationist]] regimes. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because [[New Zealand national rugby union team|its national rugby union team]] had toured [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC boycott&quot; /&gt; Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC boycott&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109‚Äì110 |pages=584‚Äì585 |date=November‚ÄìDecember 1976 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC flag]] and [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|anthem]] as long as the name was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore107/ore107i.pdf |title=Game playing in Montreal |work=Olympic Review |publisher=International Olympic Committee |pages=461‚Äì462 |issue=107‚Äì108 |date=October 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;corbit&quot; /&gt;

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's Games. The United States and sixty-four other countries boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics in 1980]] because of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81, the lowest number since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/moscow-1980-summer-olympics |title=Moscow 1980|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics of 1984]], contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes. Soviet officials defended their decision to withdraw from the Games by saying that &quot;chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burns |first=John F. |title=Protests are Issue: Russians Charge 'Gross Flouting' of the Ideals of the Competition |work=The New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |date=9 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the [[Friendship Games]], in July and August.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980 Boycott&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1980 Boycott 2&quot; /&gt;

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]], and in response to [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan disturbances]]. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australia: Calls to Boycott Beijing Olympics |work=Inter Press Service |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41699 |accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EUTibet&quot; /&gt; In August 2008, the government of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] called for a boycott of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], set to be held in [[Sochi]], Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20110127092759 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0711/p06s01-woeu.html |title=Putin Faces Green Olympic Challenge: The Sochi 2014 Winter Games are threatened by a looming international boycott, environmental concerns, and public protests against local development }}, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.

===Politics===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G00630, Sommerolympiade, Siegerehrung Weitsprung.jpg|thumb|Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].]]

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the [[Nazism|National Socialist Party]] as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]], though they used the Games to display [[Aryan]] superiority.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=107}} Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of [[Aryan]] supremacy, but notable victories by African American [[Jesse Owens]], who won four gold medals, and [[Hungary at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] Jew [[Ibolya Cs√°k]], blunted the message.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|pp=111‚Äì112}} The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organizations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the &quot;bourgeois&quot; Olympics with the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|Workers Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSE&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Roche|2000|p=106}} It was not until the [[Soviet Union at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Games]] that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=[[Olympic Review]] |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |issue=84 |pages=530‚Äì557 |date=October 1974 |format=PDF |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200&amp;nbsp;meters, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, [[Peter Norman]] of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for human rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Salute&quot; /&gt; During the same Olympics, [[Czechoslovakia]]n gymnast [[Vƒõra ƒå√°slavsk√°]] announced her protest to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the [[Balance beam|Beam]] and a shared Gold on the [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]]. During the Soviet anthem, ƒå√°slavsk√° turned her head down and to the right of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of [[Gymnastics]]. Returning home, ƒå√°slavsk√° was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian [[judoka]], [[Arash Miresmaeili]], did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=8 September 2004|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of performance-enhancing drugs===
{{main|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games}}
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]] running the [[marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].]]
In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve and increase their athletic abilities. In 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medalist for the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.&lt;ref name=&quot;wadahistory&quot; /&gt; By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.{{sfn|Porterfield|2008|p=15}} One of the  most publicized doping-related disqualification occurred after the  [[1988 Summer Olympics]] where Canadian sprinter, [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] (who won the 100-metre dash) tested  positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, by forming the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wadahistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=19 August 2008|publisher=Express India Newspapers|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested.

===Sex discrimination===
{{main|Women at the Olympics}}
[[File:Charlotte Cooper.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charlotte Cooper (tennis)|Charlotte Cooper]] of the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]], first woman Olympic champion, in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Games]].]]

Women were first allowed to compete at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, but at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] thirty-five countries were still fielding all-male delegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, [[Bahrain at the Olympics|Bahrain]] sent two women competitors for the first time: [[Fatema Hameed Gerashi]] and [[Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/23/anderson_arab_women/ &quot;Arab women make breakthrough at Games&quot;], CNN, 23 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Robina Muqimyar]] and [[Fariba Rezayee]] became the first women to compete for [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan at the Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3826673.stm &quot;Afghan women's Olympic dream&quot;], BBC, 22 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United Arab Emirates at the Olympics|United Arab Emirates]] sent female athletes ([[Maitha bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maitha Al Maktoum]] competed in taekwondo, and [[Latifa bint Ahmed Al Maktoum|Latifa Al Maktoum]] in equestrian) to the Olympic Games for the first time. Both athletes were from [[Al Maktoum|Dubai's ruling family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Should Saudi Arabia be Banned from the Olympics? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-wallechinsky/should-saudi-arabia-be-ba_b_115736.html |publisher=''Huffington Post'' |date=29 July 2008 |first=David |last=Wallechinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: [[Brunei at the Olympics|Brunei]], [[Saudi Arabia at the Olympics|Saudi Arabia]], and [[Qatar at the Olympics|Qatar]]. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would &quot;press&quot; these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. [[Anita DeFrantz]], chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] announced that it &quot;hoped to send up to four female athletes in [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics|shooting]] and [[Fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|fencing]]&quot; to the 2012 Summer Games in London.

In 2008, [[Ali Al-Ahmed]], director of the [[Institute for Gulf Affairs]], likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: &quot;For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organizations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination. [...] While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; In July 2010, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported: &quot;Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. [...] Should Saudi Arabia [...] send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot; /&gt;

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], [[Great Britain]], for the first time in Olympic history, every country competing included female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis to send 2 women to London, make history |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html |publisher=SI.com |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120715100639/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com:80/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html |archivedate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one ([[Maziah Mahusin]], in the 400m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first female Olympians, [[Bahiya al-Hamad]] (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18813543 &quot;London 2012 Olympics: Saudi Arabian women to compete&quot;], BBC, 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and runner [[Maryam Yusuf Jamal]] of [[Bahrain]] became the first Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's 1500 metres|1500 m race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/13/232068.html|title=Female Gulf athletes make their mark in London Olympics|agency=AFP|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no &quot;Women's Eventing&quot;, or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the program in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8196879.stm &quot;Women's boxing gains Olympic spot&quot;], British Broadcasting Corporation, 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter Olympics, women are still unable to compete in the [[Nordic Combined]]. There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: [[synchronized swimming]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]].

===Terrorism and violence===
Three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The [[Russo-Georgian War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese president]] [[Hu Jintao]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC 2009-01-30&quot; /&gt; When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's 10 metre air pistol|10&amp;nbsp;metre air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=10 August 2008 | date=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], Germany, eleven members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were taken hostage by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and 5 terrorists also perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Rudolph]], an [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|American domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], took place just five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|day's events]]. They included the flag that flew at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Daniel Rodr√≠guez (tenor)|Daniel Rodr√≠guez]] singing &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot;, and honor guards of NYPD and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] members. The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/05/03/ioc-bin-laden-killing-no-bearing-olympic-security|title=IOC on bin Laden killing: no bearing on Olympic security|date=3 May 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonialism===
{{Main|Colonialism and the Olympic Games}}
The Olympic Games have been criticized as upholding (and in some cases increasing) the [[Colonialism|colonial]] policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organizing committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused: erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production; erasure; commodification&lt;ref&gt;Definition: &quot;‚Ä¶the process of transforming an object, idea, activity, or service into a commodity by capitalist economies.&quot; Beaster-Jones 2013, par. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism; theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects; further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands; and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at: the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri]]; the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec]]; the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta]]; and the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia]].

==Citizenship==

===IOC rules for citizenship===
The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country for which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.{{r|Olympic Charter 2011}} This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.{{sfn|Shachar|2011|pp=2114‚Äì2116}}

===Reasons for changing citizenship===
Athletes will sometimes become citizens of a different nation so they are able to compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Citizenship changes and disputes===
One of the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was [[Zola Budd]], a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born in Britain, but British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/feb/24/athletics.rorycarroll |title=What Zola Budd did next |work=The Guardian |date= 24 February 2003 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable examples include Kenyan runner [[Bernard Lagat]], who became a United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics even though he had already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardizing his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |title=Lagat a runner without a country |publisher=Cool Running |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball player [[Becky Hammon]] was not being considered for the United States Olympic team but wanted to play in an Olympic Games, so she emigrated to Russia, where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason. Hammon received criticism from some Americans, including the US national team coach, even being called unpatriotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3427182 |title=Olympics opportunity too much for Hammon to pass up ‚Äì Olympics ‚Äì ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champions and medalists==
{{further|Lists of Olympic medalists|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeijingOlymp-1&quot; /&gt; The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics|title=St Louis 1904|publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nations==

===Nations at the Summer Olympics===
{{main|List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games}}
As of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Games]] in London, all of the current 204 NOCs have participated in at least one edition of the Olympic Summer Olympics, and athletes from [[Australia]], [[France]]{{ref label|FRA|A|a}}, [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Greece]], and [[Switzerland]]{{ref label|Eq56|B|e}} have competed in all twenty-seven [[Summer Olympic Games]].

===Nations at the Winter Olympics===
{{main|List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games}}
119 NOCs (110 of the current 204 NOCs and 9 obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one Winter Games, and twelve nations ([[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]) have participated in all twenty-two Winter Games to date. Including continuity from [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] have also been represented in every edition.

===Host nations and cities===
[[File:Summer olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Summer Olympics locations. Countries that have hosted one Summer Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue.]]
[[File:Winter olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Winter Olympics locations. Countries that have hosted one Winter Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue.]]
{{main|List of Olympic Games host cities}}{{see also|List of Olympic medals by host nation}}

The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;hostcity&quot; /&gt; In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;hostcity&quot; /&gt;

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt; After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidpro&quot; /&gt;

By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92&amp;nbsp;years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in [[Rio de Janeiro]] will be the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.

The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games, four Summer and four Winter, more than any other nation. The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games, all Summer, more than any other city. The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany, Australia, France and Greece. The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles, Paris and Athens. With the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, Japan and Tokyo, respectively, will hold these statuses.

In addition to the United States, nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, Canada and Italy have hosted twice. Among host cities, [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[Innsbruck]] and [[St. Moritz]] have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once, each holding that honor twice. The most recent Winter Games were held in [[Sochi]] in 2014, [[Russia]]'s first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall.

The '''Dew Tour''' is an [[extreme sports]] circuit organized by the [[Alli Sports]] division of [[NBC Sports Group]].

==History==
{{expand section|early history|date=April 2016}}

The Dew Tour was originally formed as a joint venture between [[NBC Sports]] and [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]]. In 2008, NBC sold a stake in the series to [[MTV Networks]], forming a new joint venture [[Alli Sports|Alli]] to manage the series, and broadcasting events on [[MTV2]]. Following the acquisition of [[NBC Universal]] by [[Comcast]], MTV sold its stake back to NBC in June 2011, with events being aired on [[NBCSN]] and [[Comcast SportsNet]] networks.&lt;ref name=sbj-allimtv&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC buys back Dew Tour stake from MTV|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/06/20/Media/Dew-Tour.aspx|publisher=Sports Business Journal|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alli-nbc&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Sports moving action sports programming to Versus|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/11/14/Media/Dew-Tour.aspx|publisher=Sports Business Journal|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Winter Dew Tour, a spin-off focusing on [[winter sport]]s, was held in late-2008/early-2009 with events in [[snowboarding]] and [[freestyle skiing]].&lt;ref name=gobreck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobreck.com/press-releases/2008/november/12/worlds-top-athletes-shaun-white-hannah-teter-travis-rice-tanner-hall |title=World's Top Athletes Shaun White, Hannah Teter, Travis Rice, Tanner Hall and Sarah Burke Lead Impressive List of Athletes Competing on Winter Dew Tour |publisher=gobreck.com |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 season, the Dew Tour was reduced to three stops from seven; with two summer events in [[Ocean City, Maryland]] and [[San Francisco]], and a winter event in [[Breckenridge, Colorado]]; management argued that the increased saturation of extreme sports events made it harder to attract athletes to participate. Streetstyle and [[slopestyle]] events were also introduced in San Francisco and Breckenridge respectively. Although total attendance and television viewership was down for the season, the average attendance rose, and viewership of digital content also increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fewer equals better for Dew Tour|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/01/07/Events-and-Attractions/Dew-Tour.aspx|website=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the [[United States Ski and Snowboard Association]] reached an agreement with Alli to allow the Winter Dew Tour event in Breckenridge to serve as a qualifying event for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] team. The arrangement gave the USSA control over certain aspects of the event, such as its format, and selling advertising to its own official sponsors during the telecast, and to promote its own Grand Prix series.&lt;ref name=sbj-dewtourqualifier&gt;{{cite web|title=Dew Tour to become Olympic qualifier|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/05/20/Olympics/Dew-Tour.aspx|work=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

The main disciplines of the games are [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[orienteering]], [[judo]] and [[chess]] as individual events.

== History ==

In 1923 student organizations of [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] established an extensive co-operation agreement, which resulted in first regional student competition for the university students of the respective countries in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. The competitions lasted until 1940 when the last winter games were held before the ties between Baltic States were severed by [[World War II]]. During this period there were organized separately summer games, winter games and chess tournaments. 
After Baltic States became independent again the tradition of competition was restored in a meeting held 21.4. 1997, and the SELL Games were organized in 1998 in Tartu. The competition has been open to all university students around the world since then.

The '''Friendship Games''', or '''Friendship-84''' ({{lang-ru|–î—Ä—É–∂–±–∞-84}}, ''Druzhba-84''), was an international [[multi-sport event]] held between 2 July and 16 September 1984 in the [[Soviet Union]] and eight other [[socialist state]]s which [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Although Friendship Games officials denied that the Games were to be a counter-Olympic event&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed&gt;{{cite news |date=17 August 1984|title=Eastern-bloc athletes exceed 10 golden efforts |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3ZImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bAEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=987,707190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 1984 |title=Friendship Games show what might have been at LA |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hpoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4553,6903778}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid conflicts with the [[International Olympic Committee]],&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=generic-competition&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 August 1984 |title=Generic competition |newspaper=The [[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]| location=[[Hendersonville, North Carolina]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NmwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q04EAAAAIBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; the competition was often dubbed the [[Eastern Bloc]]'s &quot;alternative Olympics&quot;.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference&gt;{{cite news|date=25 May 1984|title=Eastern Bloc calls for alternative Olympics |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=trAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2707,2998548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soviet-officials-shy&gt;{{cite news|date=24 August 1984|title=Soviet officials shy from comparing Olympic, Friendship games |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jMkyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XO8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5432,2027294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner1&gt;{{cite news|date=7 July 1984 |title=Will Turner televise Soviet bloc games?|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=csUUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5224,1434756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fifty states took part in the competition.

==Background==
[[File:Juan Antonio Samaranch DF-ST-01-00128.JPEG.jpg|thumb|left| [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] (''2000 photograph''), [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in May 1984, attempting to change their decision on boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]]. Instead, the socialist states used this meeting to discuss details of their own multi-sport event, the Friendship Games. Samaranch's only success was [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]'s confirmation that it would not join the boycott.]]

On 8 May 1984, less than three months before the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were scheduled to begin, the [[Soviet Union]] announced its decision to boycott the Games, citing lack of security for Soviet athletes in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Soviet-pullout-rocks-Games&gt;{{cite news |date=9 May 1984 |title=Soviet pullout rocks Games |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eVwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1833,4342317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news agency further accused the [[United States]] of trying to &quot;exploit the Games for its political purposes&quot;&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Alternate Games Would Repudiate Charter |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-_EuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UM8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1287,7742871}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the &quot;arrogant, hegemonic course of the Washington administration in international relations is at odds with the noble ideals of the Olympic movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=Alternate-Games-Would-Repudiate-Charter /&gt;
In an article published by the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' several hours before the official announcement, [[Victor Louis (journalist)|Victor Louis]] ‚Äì a Soviet journalist writing for the Western press, thought to be used by the [[Kremlin]] as an unofficial means of leaking information to the West&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 1)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6804,4042639 }} {{cite news|last1=Lowitt |first1=Bruce |date=14 May 1984 |title= Afghanistan Joins Boycott (part 2)|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=-MMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5131,4049411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulgaria-pulls-out-Reagan-intervenes&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 1984 |title=Bulgaria pulls out, Reagan intervenes|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=auYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7131,2161071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì first informed the world of the USSR's decision to boycott, adding that detailed plans for the &quot;Soviet bloc's alternative games&quot; had already been made.

Louis wrote another article on 13 May, for the French ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'',&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; once again stating that the Soviet Union was contemplating counter-Olympic Games, possibly held in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria. However, this time he noted that the idea was unlikely, as the Soviets feared that organizing such an event might prompt the [[International Olympic Committee]] to exclude the USSR.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; On the same day, Soviet sports commentator Vsevold Kuskuskin, during an interview for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]'', said the [[Eastern Bloc]] would definitely not organize such games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt; Also on 13 May, [[Laos]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] announced their decision to boycott the Los Angeles games.&lt;ref name=Afghanistan-Joins-Boycott /&gt;&lt;ref name=Czechoslovakia-Laos-join-the-list&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joyce |first1=Dick |date=13 May 1984 |title=Czechoslovakia, Laos join the list|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-R8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=facEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1529,6975019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May, Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, called a press conference to discuss the boycott.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming&gt;{{cite news|date=15 May 1984|title=Soviets, slamming Olympics door, charge US plot |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0515/051549.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conference, Gramov assured &quot;Moscow would not support any alternative games staged to compete with the Olympics&quot;.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; On the same day, [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] stated that, while Eastern Bloc officials had vetoed a counter-Olympics idea, the Bloc would instead &quot;sponsor sports events in various nations as a substitute for participation in the Los Angeles games&quot;,&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt; holding them at a different time than the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Soviets-slamming /&gt;

[[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] became the ninth country to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics on 16 May, followed by Poland a day later.&lt;ref name=Hungary-joins&gt;{{cite news |date=16 May 1984 |title=Hungary joins Soviet boycott |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=sbAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5389,2026175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poland-10th&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnard |first1=William R. |date=17 May 1984 |title=Poland 10th to join Olympic boycott |newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] |url=http://news.google.ie/newspapers?id=4g8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6350,599674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May, Olaf Brockmann of Austrian newspaper ''[[Die Presse]]'', citing Alexander Ushakov, head trainer of the Soviet decathlon team, said Eastern Bloc countries were hastily arranging a series of sports events.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing&gt;{{cite news |date=20 May 1984 |title=Soviet Bloc Discussing Own Games |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HR8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6793,2319906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockmann named five competitions: two track and field athletics meets, one to be held in [[Prague]], Czechoslovakia, and the other in [[East Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]], East Germany; plus fencing, modern pentathlon and boxing events to be held in Poland.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt; Ushakov reportedly said the events would be held either before or after the Olympics, to avoid conflicts with the IOC, which would ban any form of counter-Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=Soviet-Bloc-Discussing /&gt;

[[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], [[Presidents of the International Olympic Committee|President of the IOC]], held a conference with Olympic Committees of eleven Eastern Bloc countries (eight of the boycotting states ‚Äì Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, the Soviet Union and Vietnam ‚Äì plus [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]])&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 1984 |title=Communist nations plan own games |newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SZUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s1YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1054,3766667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Prague, Czechoslovakia, starting on 21 May.&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders&gt;{{cite news |date=21 May 1984 |title=Communist leaders confer on Olympics |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XzAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=66UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5073,6946151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaranch hoped to convince the boycotting states to change their position,&lt;ref name=Communist-leaders /&gt; but while Romania assured him it would attend the Los Angeles Olympics,&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; the remaining ten countries did not change their stance and even used the meeting to discuss &quot;their own summer games&quot;.&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; The official announcement was made by Antonin Himl, President of the Czech National Olympic Committee, who appeared on Prague television on 24 May.&lt;ref name=Prague-Conference /&gt;&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl said that, after the Olympic Games ended, various Eastern bloc countries would hold their own sport events in Olympic disciplines.&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Himl stated that the games' intention would be to &quot;give athletes who have conscientiously prepared for the past four years a possibility to sell their abilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=Communist-nations-plan /&gt; Thus, the Friendship Games idea was officially proclaimed.

Himl said the games would be held after 12 August (i.e. after the Summer Olympics), and that his country, Czechoslovakia, would host gymnastics, archery, women's handball, and women's track and field athletics.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 1984 |title= Boycott nations will stage own games |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-YNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3969,6224193}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave assurances that the events would be open to all athletes, including those from non-boycotting nations.&lt;ref name=Boycott-nations /&gt;

Soon after the meeting, Cuba also announced its decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maxwell |first1=Evan |date=24 May 1984|title=Cuba Joins Olympic Boycott |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/676722322.html?dids=676722322:676722322&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+24%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of June, [[North Korea]], [[South Yemen]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Angola]] had done the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 May 1984|title=Marxist South Yemen Becomes 12th Country to Drop Out of L.A.

In June, the Soviet Union asked [[Ted Turner]] and his [[Turner Broadcasting System]] to televise the events held in Hungary for American audiences.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner1 /&gt; Turner eventually declined, but assured that his network would give spot coverage to the Games and treat it as any other sporting event.&lt;ref name=Ted-Turner2&gt;{{cite news |date=7 July 1984|title=Sports People; Turner Backs Off |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/sports/sports-people-turner-backs-off.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating nations==

Initial estimates placed the number of athletes participating in Soviet event venues at approximately 8,000.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage /&gt; Later, the number of expected participants was lowered to 2,300, representing 49 countries.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=Good-times&gt;{{cite news|date=18 August 1984|title=Good times are in order at the Friendship Games|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6955,827200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Infosport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Infosport (&quot;1984&quot; section)|url=http://www.infosport.ru/memoryPro/DocMemory.asp|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all the expected athletes showed up.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The exact number of athletes who took part in events held outside of the Soviet Union is unknown.

While Olympic-boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;

==Opening ceremony==
Although the Games began on 2 July with table tennis events held in North Korea, the official opening ceremony was held on 18 August in Moscow, soon after the first events hosted by the Soviet Union started.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmemann |first1=Serge |date=19 August 1984|title=Friendship Games open with a Soviet challenge |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fpoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2829,2815005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp&gt;{{cite news |date=19 August 1984 |title=Friendship Games open with pomp|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a_MRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3838,1743115 | location=[[Spokane]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-hour ceremony held at the [[Luzhniki Stadium|Central Lenin Stadium]]&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; included &quot;girls in white leotards [spinning] red and white beachballs in unison, (...) dozens of children in traditional costumes of the Soviet republics&quot;,&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a &quot;squadron of young performers&quot; which created &quot;a human weaving machine by ducking and turning to mesh their colored banners&quot;&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and &quot;red-attired teenage girls with silver [[hula hoop]]s&quot;, which spelled the words 'USSR' and 'peace'.&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; The ceremony was described as being &quot;reminiscent of [[Olympic opening ceremony|Olympic galas]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt;

As in Olympic opening ceremonies,&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; a torch bearer (Soviet runner and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] gold medalist [[Viktor Markin]]) carried the flame into the stadium&lt;ref name=open-with-pomp /&gt; and lit a giant bowl which had been built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics.&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt; The torch had been lit from an [[eternal flame]] for [[World War II]] victims located in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Teams marched onto the stadium behind flags, but unlike in the Olympics, they were not national teams but sporting organisations, such as [[Dynamo Sports Club|Dynamo]] or [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak]].&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Songs performed during the ceremony included a 1918 military march dedicated to the [[Red Army]], &quot;Stadium of My Dreams&quot;, written for the 1980 Olympics,&lt;ref name=who-is-coming&gt;{{cite news|date=17 August 1984|title=Games open but just who is coming? |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=afMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6976,823056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a specially composed song with the chorus &quot;To a sunny peace ‚Äì yes, yes, yes / To a nuclear blast ‚Äì no, no, no.&quot;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eaton |first1=William |date=19 August 1984|title=Peace dominating message at Friendship Games opening|newspaper=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hPEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=708DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2742,3591862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Games-open-with-challenge /&gt;

Events were hosted by nine countries (Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, and the Soviet Union) between 2 July and 16 September 1984. With the exception of equestrian jumping, no events were held during the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (held between 28 July and 12 August).

The Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except [[association football]] and [[synchronized swimming]]), and in non-Olympic [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], and [[sambo (martial art)|sambo wrestling]]. Additionally, the Friendship Games included non-Olympic women's shooting and rhythmic gymnastic events but not women's road race cycling, which became an Olympic event in 1984.

===Archery===
{{main|Archery at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union won five out of six possible medals.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0603-003, Uwe Hohn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Uwe Hohn]] won the gold medal in javelin throw]]

===Athletics===
{{main|Athletics at the Friendship Games}}
In an interview shortly before the events began, the Soviet team's coach [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]] said his athletes beat more than ten world records during the preparations for the competition.&lt;ref name=who-is-coming /&gt; While the Soviet athletes set no new records during the Games, they still dominated, winning more than a half of the gold medals. The only new world record was set by East German [[Irina Meszynski]] in women's discus throw, with 73.36 m.

Athletics was the only discipline which saw participation of recent [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medalists, with American sprinter [[Alice Brown (athlete)|Alice Brown]] taking part in women's 100-metre run, and West German [[Claudia Losch]] competing in shot put. However, neither won medals.&lt;ref name=Westerners-expected&gt;{{cite news|date=16 August 1984|title=Westerners expected at Communist Games|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dAYjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Us0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5774,4662666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harvey |first1=Randy |date=25 August 1984|title=Tired Kratochvilova Beats U.S. Olympic Stars in 400|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unusual feat, [[Alberto Juantorena]] (Cuba) and [[Ryszard Ostrowski]] (Poland) both crossed the finish line at exactly the same moment in the men's 800-metre run. After the officials were unable to decide who came first ‚Äì even after examining a [[photograph]] ‚Äì both were declared winners.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

The annual [[Moscow International Peace Marathon|Moscow marathon]] was declared to be a Friendship Games event in 1984. This caused a minor controversy, as the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] guards of the [[Embassy of the United States in Moscow|American embassy]], who usually took part in it, withdrew after learning it would be treated as a Friendship Games competition.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt;

===Basketball===
{{main|Basketball at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union won the men's final against Czechoslovakia 105:70, and Cuba came in third ahead of Poland. The USSR also finished first in the women's event, but since it was a [[round-robin tournament]], there were no semifinals or finals.

===Boxing===
{{main|Boxing at the Friendship Games}}
The host nation, Cuba, fully dominated the event, winning eleven out of twelve gold medals. East German [[Torsten Schmitz]] in the [[welterweight]] category was the only non-Cuban to win gold. [[Te√≥filo Stevenson]], three-time consecutive Olympic gold medalist who lost the chance to win his fourth gold when Cuba boycotted the Los Angeles Games, won the super heavyweight category.

Boxing was one of just three disciplines in which the Soviet Union did not win a gold medal, the others being modern pentathlon and table tennis.

===Canoeing===
{{main|Canoeing at the Friendship Games}}
Hosts East Germany and the Soviet Union won all twelve gold medals, six apiece.

===Cycling===
{{main|Cycling at the Friendship Games}}
The [[Schleizer Dreieck]] in [[Schleiz]], East Germany, usually used as a car or motorcycle race track, served as cycling venue for the individual road race. The event saw participation of top cyclists of the era, including numerous [[Peace Race]] veterans such as [[Uwe Ampler]] and [[Uwe Raab]].

===Diving===
{{main|Diving at the Friendship Games}}
Diving was yet another event dominated by East Germans and Soviets. Gold medalists included [[Aleksandr Portnov]] and [[Brita Baldus]].

===Equestrian===
{{main|Equestrian at the Friendship Games}}
Equestrian events were the only discipline contested at the same time as the 1984 Summer Olympics, as jumping events took place between 6 and 10 August. It was also the only discipline in which West German and Italian athletes won medals.

In individual dressage, [[Yuri Kovshov]] won both gold and silver, riding two different horses.

===Fencing===
{{main|Fencing at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet fencers won most of the men's events, while Hungary won both women's events, thanks to [[Gertr√∫d Stefanek]] and [[Edit Kov√°cs]].

===Field hockey===
{{main|Field hockey at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union &quot;A&quot; team won the men's tournament, and while the Soviet Union &quot;B&quot; team came in third, fourth-place finishers [[Zimbabwe]] were awarded the bronze medal.

A team representing the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] also competed in the men's event, but lost all its matches, including a 0:27 loss to East Germany.

===Gymnastics===
{{main|Gymnastics at the Friendship Games}}
In artistic gymnastics, [[Olga Mostepanova]] achieved perfect &quot;10&quot; scores ten times: four in individual competitions, and six in team events.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; All fifteen medals in rhythmic gymnastics were won by just four athletes: Bulgarians [[Anelia Ralenkova]] and [[Diliana Gueorguieva]], and Soviets [[Galina Beloglazova]] and [[Dalia Kutkaitƒó]].

===Handball===
{{main|Handball at the Friendship Games}}
East Germany won the men's event, thanks to an 18:17 win over the Soviet Union, while Poland came in third. [[P√©ter Kov√°cs (handballer)|P√©ter Kov√°cs]] of Hungary was the top scorer with 26 goals. The USSR finished first in the women's tournament.

===Judo===
{{main|Judo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet Union again won most of the gold medals. The event was also particularly successful for Poland, which won seven medals.

===Modern pentathlon===
{{main|Modern pentathlon at the Friendship Games}}
Hungarian [[L√°szl√≥ F√°bi√°n (pentathlete)|L√°szl√≥ F√°bi√°n]] won the individual competition, and Hungary also won the team event.

===Rowing===
{{main|Rowing at the Friendship Games}}
The USSR took 11 out of 14 gold medals, while East Germany captured the remaining three.

===Sailing===
{{main|Sailing at the Friendship Games}}
Sailing took place on the [[Baltic Sea]], near [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]], with the exception of 470 and Finn classes, which were contested on [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary. Soviets and East Germans won all of the gold medals. [[Canada]] and [[Finland]] won their only Friendship Games medals.

===Shooting===
{{main|Shooting at the Friendship Games}}
While most disciplines mimicked the Olympic Games in terms of events, women's shooting included non-Olympic competitions, namely the [[10 metre air pistol]] and [[50 metre rifle three positions]] events.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0619-033, Sylvia Gerasch.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvia Gerasch]] ''(1987 photograph)'', a 15-year-old, set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke]]

===Swimming===
{{main|Swimming at the Friendship Games}}
Five new world records were set during the competition. [[Sergei Zabolotnov]]'s result of 1:58.41 in men's 200 metre backstroke excited the crowd, as it was some one and a half seconds better than [[Rick Carey]]'s result during the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen-year-old [[Sylvia Gerasch]] of [[East Germany]] set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke and was also part of the relay team that beat the 4 √ó 100 m medley record.&lt;ref name=Soviet-officials-shy /&gt;

===Table tennis===
{{main|Table tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Table tennis, a non-Olympic sport at that time, was the only event hosted by North Korea, which won four out of seven gold medals. Notably, the [[People's Republic of China]], which was at odds with most socialist states following the [[Sino-Soviet split]], took part in the event.

===Tennis===
{{main|Tennis at the Friendship Games}}
Soviet players dominated the singles category, and also won the men's doubles event. The Czechoslovakian women's double team was the only non-Soviet team to win gold.

===Volleyball===
{{main|Volleyball at the Friendship Games}}
Not surprisingly, the Soviet team finished first in the men's event, over Cuba and Poland. In women's tournament, Cuba won the final against the USSR.

===Water polo===
{{main|Water polo at the Friendship Games}}
The Soviet team ‚Äì composed mostly of the players who won gold during the 1980 Summer Olympics ‚Äì finished first, while Hungary and Cuba took the second and third spots.

===Weightlifting===
{{main|Weightlifting at the Friendship Games}}
Dominated by Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the event saw thirty world records broken,&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p186&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; including two in the super heavyweight category, set by [[Anatoly Pisarenko]].

===Wrestling===
{{main|Wrestling at the Friendship Games}}
In addition to [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] events, non-Olympic [[sambo (martial art)|sambo]] wrestling events were also contested. Sambo was the only event hosted by Mongolia.

==Medal table==
The following table is based on statistics from the books ''Na olimpijskim szlaku 1984'' and ''Gwiazdy sportu '84'' and does not include sambo wrestling results.

==Comparisons to the Olympic Games==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0602-003, Marlies G√∂hr.jpg|thumb|[[Marlies G√∂hr]] won the women's 100 metre event with 10.95, slightly faster than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the Olympics]]
Media on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] frequently compared the results of 1984 Summer Olympics and the Friendship Games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=athletics-comparsion&gt;{{cite news |date=18 August 1984|title=Olympic vs. Friendship Games comparison|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7182,828814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afro-American&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacy |first1=Sam |date=1 September 1984|title=For what it means: Olympic vs. Friendship|newspaper=The [[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wyImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xf4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5882,952037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths&gt;{{cite news |last1=Henry III |first1=William A. |last2=Cazeneuve |first2=Brian |last3=Donnelly |first3=Sally B. |date=19 September 1988|title=Olympics: Colliding Myths After a Dozen Years |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968447,00.html#ixzz0pDG1FkXk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Over sixty Friendship Games results would have secured medals at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; East Bloc athletes outperformed Olympic winners in 20 of 41 track-and-field events and eleven of 29 swimming events.&lt;ref name=Olympics-Colliding-Myths /&gt; Had [[Li Yuwei]], who won the 1984 Olympic gold medal in [[50 metre running target]] shooting, obtained the same score in the Friendship Games, he would have only placed sixth.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p183&gt;Chmielewski (1987), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in events such as weightlifting or wrestling, the Friendship Games had almost all of the top athletes of the time.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski-p151 /&gt;

However, some journalists noted that making such comparisons was unjustified, because of differing conditions and equipment. For example, [[Marlies G√∂hr]]'s result of 10.95 in women's 100 metre run was slightly better than [[Evelyn Ashford]]'s winning time of 10.97 at the 1984 Olympics, but when the two met head-to-head a week after the Friendship Games, Ashford was much faster than G√∂hr and set the new world record.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/moresports/columns/hollobaugh_jeff/57480.html |title=Szabo is in the money (&quot;No. 94&quot; section) |last1=Hollobaugh |first1=Jeff |date=14 September 1998 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eastern Bloc results in track cycling were better than Olympic results, but Friendship Games cyclists competed on an indoor wooden track, while the Olympic events took place on an outdoor concrete track.&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt; &quot;It is like saying [[Carl Lewis]] was faster than [[Jesse Owens]], [[Muhammad Ali]] would have beaten [[Joe Louis]] or [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] would have outrun [[Man o' War]]&quot;, [[Sam Lacy]] of ''[[Afro-American (newspaper)|The Afro-American]]'' concluded.&lt;ref name=Afro-American /&gt;

The comparisons also had political significance. While Friendship Games organizers repeatedly assured the press that their event was not an &quot;alternative Olympics&quot;,&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=what-might-have-been /&gt;&lt;ref name=Russians-host&gt;{{cite news |date=12 August 1984|title=Russians Host Their Own '84 Games |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8MYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OmkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6606,984761}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably to avoid punitive IOC measures,&lt;ref name=Eastern-bloc-exceed /&gt;&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; Soviet state-run media often alluded to such comparisons.&lt;ref name=peace-dominating /&gt; The TASS agency declared that the Eastern Bloc's games were a &quot;major event in the Olympic year&quot;,&lt;ref name=Moscow-to-stage&gt;{{cite news |date=10 August 1984 |title=Moscow to stage games |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3570,4959807}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Sovietsky Sport newspaper described the Games as the &quot;main event of the Olympic [[wikt:quadrennium|quadrennium]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, said that the &quot;socialist nations remain faithful to the task of strengthening the unity of the Olympics movement&quot;,&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt; while describing the Los Angeles Games as full of &quot;chauvinism and [[Folie √† deux|mass psychosis]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Russians-host /&gt;

When asked about the Friendship Games, Monique Berlioux, then director of the IOC, said she had &quot;no reaction whatsoever&quot; to the competition.&lt;ref name=generic-competition /&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 2006, the [[Law and Justice]] party in Poland proposed granting Friendship Games medalists sports retirement benefits similar to those given to Olympic medalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pis.org.pl/unit.php?o=parlament&amp;p=docs&amp;id=2&amp;iddoc=33 |title=Projekt ustawy o zmianie ustawy o sporcie kwalifikowanym |language=pl |publisher=[[Law and Justice]] party |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was never voted upon.

The '''Mediterranean Games''' are a multi-sport games held every four years, between nations around or very close to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], where Europe, Africa and Asia meet. The games are under the auspices of the [[Comit√© international des Jeux m√©diterran√©ens|International Committee of Mediterranean Games]] (CIJM).

==History==
The idea was proposed at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] by [[Muhammed Taher Pasha]], chairman of the [[Egyptian Olympic Committee]] and vice-president of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (I.O.C.), assisted by the Greek member of the I.O.C. Ioannis Ketseas.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Mediterranean Games|url=http://www.cijm.org.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27&amp;lang=en|website=International Committee of Mediterranean Games|publisher=CIJM|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 an unofficial event was held in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/mg.htm|title=Mediterranean Games|publisher=gbrathletics.com|accessdate=21 December 2012|quote=The Mediterranean Games were first held in 1951, although an unofficial Games was previously held in 1949.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first official Mediterranean Games were held in Egypt in 1951.

The Games were inaugurated in October 1951, in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], in honour of [[Muhammed Taher Pasha]], with contests being held in 13 sports along with the participation of 734 athletes from 10 countries. In 1955, in [[Barcelona]], during the II Games, the set up was decided of a Supervisory and Controlling Body for the Games, a kind of Executive Committee. The decisions were finally materialized on June 16, 1961, and the said Body was named, upon a Greek notion, ICMG (International Committee for the Mediterranean Games).

The first 11 games took place always one year preceding the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. However, from 1993 on, they were held the year following the Olympic games. This transition meant that the only time the Mediterranean Games were not held four years after the previous Games was in 1993, when [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] in France hosted the Games just two years after [[Athens]].

==Description==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
The Mediterranean Games, in terms of the preparation and composition of the National Delegation, are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee and the [[Hellenic Olympic Committee]] (HOC). However, their establishment too must be credited to the HOC, for it held a leading part in their being founded despite all difficulties.

Athens is the permanent seat of the ICMG (regardless of who the President might be) and the Committee‚Äôs General Secretary is Greek. This comes as a further tribute to Greece, highlighting its leading role with regard to the function and strengthening of the institution. Except that Greece bailed out of its 2013 Mediterranean Games commitment when the two cities of [[Volos]] and [[Larissa]] were supposed to host the 2013 edition of the Games.  But because of Greece's financial troubles, they had to give that up and the 2013 honors went instead to Turkey, with the city of Mersin rescuing the 2013 edition of the Games instead.

The logo of the games, also referred to as the &quot;Mediterranean Olympics&quot;, is composed of three white rings symbolically representing [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Europe]] &amp;mdash; the three continents that border the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This logo has been used since the Split games in 1979, for which it was devised and afterwards accepted for the whole Games. During the closing ceremony, the flag of the games is transferred to the country of the city chosen for the organisation of the next Mediterranean Games.

==Participating countries==
[[File:Partecipanti GdM.png|thumb|right|300px|Participating countries]]
At present, 24 countries participate in the games:&lt;ref name=&quot;www.pescara2009.it&quot;&gt;[http://www.pescara2009.it/content.php?tipo=19&amp;editing=Mod Participating countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa|Africa]]''': [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]
*'''[[Olympic Council of Asia|Asia]]''': [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].
*'''[[European Olympic Committees|Europe]]''':  [[Albania]], [[Andorra]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[Montenegro]], [[San Marino]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]].

[[Kosovo]] was accepted as a member of the International Committee of Mediterranean Games in October 2015 and is expected to participate for the first time in the 2017 Mediterranean Games in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1031327/exclusive-kosovo-accepted-as-member-of-international-committee-of-the-mediterranean-games].&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the [[National Olympic Committee]]s within the Olympic Movement bordering the Mediterranean Sea only the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israeli]] is not permitted to participate.

Allen Guttman in ''The Games Must Go On'' argued that Israel's exclusion is both [[antisemitic]] and politically motivated due to antagonism towards Israel by the participating Arab nations. The IOC's [[Avery Brundage]] was not supportive of Israel's desire to compete, saying: &quot;I cannot understand why anyone wants to go where he is not wanted&quot;. The [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]] pushed the issue at the [[1959 Mediterranean Games]] in Beirut by refusing to grant permission to hold an [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] competition unless Israel were allowed to compete. Lebanese games organiser Gabriel Gemayel conceded to this, but sidestepped the ruling by holding a parallel ''Lebanese Games'' comprising athletics events between the present nations alongside the official Mediterranean Games competitions.&lt;ref&gt;The games must go on: Avery Brundage and the Olympic movement, Allen Guttmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nA3g4BDCVrUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA224&amp;lpg=RA1-PA224&amp;dq=anti+israel+Mediterranean+Games&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GyS7Ygr2Rf&amp;sig=NvvfqyVDSw9QJ8bpx2SZ8KCVjRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EbMRS_WTDpTSlAfSvbCQBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anti%20israel%20Mediterranean%20Games&amp;f=false page 225].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are countries not bordering the Mediterranean Sea which nonetheless participate: [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], [[Serbia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

The [[Hellenic Olympic Committee]] has suggested that nine more countries that do not satisfy geographic criteria to be allowed to participate, such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Portugal]] and some Arab countries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Flag==
The symbol of the Mediterranean Games consists of three rings representing Asia, Africa and Europe, the three continents involved in this competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;medgames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url = http://www.medgames.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=26|title = Mediterranean Games History|publisher = Mediterranean Games Site| accessdate = 2008-10-02 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings dissolve in a wavy line in their lower part, as if they were immersed in the Mediterranean Sea. During the closing ceremony, the flag is transferred to the country of the city chosen to host the next Mediterranean Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;medgames&quot;/&gt;

==Host cities==
No inland city has ever hosted the games.  All but one of the host cities to date have been situated on the Mediterranean coast.  (Casablanca is located on the Atlantic coast.)

The '''Invictus Games''' are an international [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]]-style&lt;ref name=Independent-2014-03-06/&gt; [[multi-sport event]], created by Britain's [[Prince Harry]], in which wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans take part in sports including [[wheelchair basketball]], [[sitting volleyball]], and [[indoor rower|indoor rowing]].&lt;ref name=Independent-2014-03-06/&gt; Named after [[List of Roman deities#Invictus|Invictus]], the Latin for &quot;Unconquered, Undefeated&quot; the event was inspired by the [[Warrior Games]], a similar event held in the United States. The first Invictus Games took place in 2014 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] in London, United Kingdom.

The 2014 opening ceremony was attended by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], [[Prince Harry]], [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]]. The event also included a recorded message from [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29145610 |title=Prince Harry's Invictus Games open |publisher=BBC News |date=10 September 2014 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second games opened on 8 May 2016 at the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports]] at [[Walt Disney World]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], USA. The opening ceremony was attended by Prince Harry, American First Lady Michelle Obama, Former American President [[George W. Bush]] and many other dignitaries.

The '''Commonwealth Games''' (known as the '''British Empire Games''' from 1930‚Äì1950, the '''British Empire and Commonwealth Games''' from 1954‚Äì1966, and '''British Commonwealth Games''' from 1970‚Äì1974)&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/story.asp|title=The story of the Commonwealth Games|publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation|accessdate=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an international, [[multi-sport event]] involving athletes from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then.

The games are overseen by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (CGF), which also controls the sporting programme and selects the host cities. A host city is selected for each edition. 18 cities in seven countries have hosted the event. Apart from many [[Olympic sports]], the games also include some sports that are played predominantly in Commonwealth countries, such as [[lawn bowls]] and [[netball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harold |first=Perkin |date=September 1989 |title=Teaching the nations how to play: sport and society in the British Empire and Commonwealth |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=145‚Äì155 |doi=10.1080/09523368908713685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are 53 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, 71 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games, as a number of dependent territories compete under their own flag. The four [[Home Nations]] of the [[United Kingdom]]‚ÄîEngland, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland‚Äîalso send separate teams. Only six countries have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales. Australia has been the highest achieving team for twelve games, England for seven, and Canada for one.

==History of the Games==
[[File:Hampden Park Glasgow Commonwealth Games Day 9.JPG|thumb|Athletics at the Hampden Park Stadium, Glasgow during the 2014 Commonwealth Games]]
A sporting [[competition]] bringing together the members of the [[British Empire]] was first proposed by the John Astley Cooper in 1891, when he wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' suggesting a &quot;Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire&quot;. The John Astley Cooper Committees worldwide (e.g. Australia) helped [[Pierre de Coubertin]] to get his international [[Olympic Games]] off the ground fast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Kr√ºger]] (1986): War John Astley Cooper der Erfinder der modernen Olympischen Spiele? In: LOUIS BURGENER u.a. (Hrsg.): Sport  und Kultur, Bd. 6. Bern: Lang, 72 - 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the [[Festival of the Empire]] was held at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London to celebrate the [[coronation]] of King [[George V]]. As part of the festival, an Inter-Empire Championships was held in which teams from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom competed in events such as boxing, wrestling, swimming, and athletics.

In 1928, [[Melville Marks Robinson]] of Canada was asked to organise the first British Empire Games; these were held in 1930, in [[Hamilton, Ontario]],&lt;ref name=Story /&gt; and women competed in the swimming events only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1930 British Empire Games&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Introduction|publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation|url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/intro.asp|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934, women also competed in some athletics events.

The first [[Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] were held alongside the Commonwealth Games from 1962 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DePauw|first1=Karen P|last2=Gavron|first2=Susan J|title=Disability sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPsqAoFtG-sC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=25 February 2012|year=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-4638-1|pages=102‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes with a disability were then first included in exhibition events at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in [[Victoria, British Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Ooyen and Justin Anjema |first1=Mark |last2=Anjema |first2=Justin |title=A Review and Interpretation of the Events of the 1994 Commonwealth Games |publisher=Redeemer University College |date=25 March 2004 |url=http://sporthamilton.com/content/histroy/1994commonwealthgames.pdf |accessdate=25 February 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130731114220/http://sporthamilton.com/content/histroy/1994commonwealthgames.pdf |archivedate=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, they were included as full members of their national teams, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This meant that results were included in the medal count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Para-sports for elite athletes with a disability|url=http://www.thecgf.com/sports/ead.asp|work=Commonwealth Games Federation website|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire Games flag was donated in 1931 by the British Empire Games Association of Canada. The year and location of subsequent games were added until the 1950 games. The name of the event was changed to the British Empire and Commonwealth Games and the flag was retired as a result.

The first edition of the event was the 1930 British Empire Games in which 11 nations participated. The quadrennial schedule of the games was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the 1942 Games (set to be held in Montreal) and the 1946 Games were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/templates/Games_HighAchievers.htm High Achievers]. Australian Commonwealth Games Association. Retrieved on 2010-04-05. {{wayback|url=http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/templates/Games_HighAchievers.htm |date=20140212142132 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were revived in 1950 and underwent a name change four years later with the first British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954.&lt;ref name=Story/&gt; Over 1,000 athletes participated in the 1958 Games as over thirty teams took part for the first time.&lt;ref name=Growth&gt;[http://www.thecgf.com/games/growth.asp Growth of the Commonwealth Games]. Commonwealth Games Federation. Retrieved on 2010-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 Games in Edmonton marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part.&lt;ref name=Growth/&gt; They were boycotted by [[Nigeria]], in protest of [[New Zealand]]'s sporting contacts with [[apartheid]]-era South Africa, as well as by [[Uganda]], in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacintoshHawes1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Macintosh|author2=Michael Hawes|author3=Donna Ruth Greenhorn|author4=David Ross Black|title=Sport and Canadian Diplomacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G_TwFYjUfssC&amp;pg=PA81|date=5 April 1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-1161-3|pages=81‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation at the 1986 Games was affected by a boycott by 32 African, Asian and Caribbean nations in protest of British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher's]] refusal to condemn sporting contacts of Apartheid era South Africa in 1985, but the Games rebounded and continued to grow thereafter. The 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia saw the sporting programme grow from 10 to 15 sports as [[team sports]] were allowed for the first time.&lt;ref name=Story/&gt; Participation also reached new levels as over 3500 athletes represented 70 teams at the event. At the Games in Melbourne in 2006, over 4000 athletes took part in sporting competitions.&lt;ref name=Growth/&gt;

The three nations to have hosted the games the most times are Australia (5), Canada (4) and New Zealand (3). Furthermore, six editions have taken place in the countries within the United Kingdom (Scotland 3, England 2 and Wales 1), twice in Asia (Malaysia 1 and India 1) and once in the Caribbean (Jamaica 1). Two cities have held the games on multiple occasions: Auckland (1950 and 1990), and Edinburgh (1970, 1986 and some events in 2014).

*Record (*)
;Notes
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The 1911 Inter-Empire Championships held in London is seen as a precursor to the modern Commonwealth Games, but is not normally considered an official edition of the Games themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/story.asp | title=The Story of the Commonwealth Games | publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation | accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;The [[United Kingdom]] competes as its separate [[Constituent Countries of the United Kingdom|Home Nations]], [[British Overseas Territories|Overseas Territories]], and [[Crown Dependencies]] and has held the games 6 times, 7 including the precursor 1911 Inter-Empire Championships in London.

== Ceremonies ==

=== Opening ===

The Commonwealth Games always starts with a grand opening ceremony. Various cultural and military shows are performed during the ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the current hosting nation are hoisted during the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. The [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Delhi]], India was considered to have the most grand opening ceremony in the history of any Commonwealth Games and it was highly compared with the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]] at [[Beijing]], China. The cost of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the 2010 Commonwealth Games was around $ 77 million which was the second costliest opening ceremony of any international sporting event in the world after the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The 71 [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] are called continent wise to have the athletes parade at the stadium and the last hosting nation of the games enters the first. The president or the head of the hosting nation declares the opening of the games, however the opening of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|2002]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games|2006]] and [[2014 Commonwealth Games|2014]] Commonwealth Games were declared by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].

=== Closing ===
The closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The David Dickson award for the best performance in the Commonwealth Games is presented to one athlete. The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games. Superstar [[Kylie Minogue]] performed at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|closing ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games]].

==Approved sports==
{{further2|[[Commonwealth Games sports]] and [[Commonwealth Games records]]}}
There are a total of 22 sports (with two multi-disciplinary sports) and a further seven [[para-sports]] which are approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation. They are categorised into three types. Core sports must be included on each programme. A number of optional sports may be picked by the host nation, which may include some team sports such as [[basketball]]. Recognised sports are sports which have been approved by the CGF but which are deemed to need expansion; host nations may not pick these sports for their programme until the CGF's requirements are fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Sports&gt;[http://www.thecgf.com/sports/ Sports Programme]. [[Commonwealth Games Federation]]. Retrieved on 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth nations/dependencies/disputed territories yet to send teams===
Very few Commonwealth dependencies and nations have yet to take part:

* [[Ascension Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha]], former dependencies of [[Saint Helena]] and current parts of the British Overseas Territory of [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]], have never formed their own teams independent from the Saint Helena team.
* Other states, territories and [[Autonomous region|territorial autonomies]] with native populations within the Commonwealth that may be eligible include [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] ([[States and territories of Australia|territories]] of Australia), [[Nevis]] (a federal entity of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]), [[Rodrigues]] ([[Outer islands of Mauritius|outer islands]] of [[Mauritius]]), and [[Zanzibar]] (a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania).
* [[Cornwall]], represented by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid for participation in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]] was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignkernow.com |title=Campaign Kernow |publisher=Campaign Kernow |date= |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] currently has no permanent population although there is a sizeable [[Chagossian|population]] who were ''born'' in the BIOT but currently live in [[Mauritius]] and the United Kingdom and so would be eligible to compete on birth criteria.
* [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] has made applications to the CGF to send teams.
* It is also conceivable that any future members of the Commonwealth such as [[Commonwealth of Nations#Applicants|applicants]] (for example [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]] and [[Yemen]]) may participate in future games. The [[Colony of Aden]] and [[Federation of South Arabia]], precursors to modern Yemen, participated before in [[1962 Commonwealth Games|1962]] and in [[1966 Commonwealth Games|1966]]. Sudan was an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian protectorate]] until independence in 1956.
* The [[Pitcairn Islands]]' tiny population (currently 50 to 60 people) would appear to prevent this British overseas territory from competing.
* [[Tokelau]] was [[Tokelau at the Commonwealth Games|expected to take part]] in the [[2010 Commonwealth Games|2010]] Games in Delhi but did not do so.
* The lack of a permanent population would seem to prevent the British overseas territories of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] and [[British Antarctic Territory]], the New Zealand territory of [[Ross Dependency]] and the Australian external territories of [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]] and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] from competing.

==Notable competitors==
Lawn bowler [[Willie Wood (bowler)|Willie Wood]] from [[Scotland]] was the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, a record equalled in 2014 by [[Isle of Man]] cyclist Andrew Roche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/26985985 |title=Glasgow 2014: Mark Cavendish relishes idea of racing with mates |date=10 May 2014 |accessdate=10 May 2014 |newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Greg Yelavich]], a sports shooter from New Zealand, has won 12 medals in seven games from 1986 to 2010.

[[Nauru]]an weightlifter [[Marcus Stephen]] won twelve medals at the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected [[President of Nauru]] in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent state in the Commonwealth, at 21&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and with a population of fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in nineteenth place on the [[all-time Commonwealth Games medal table]].

The '''BIMP-EAGA Friendship Games''' is a sporting biennial event between the regions of the four member countries of the [[BIMP-EAGA]]. The inaugural edition of the games took place in [[General Santos]], [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]] from 25‚Äì27 April 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bimpeaga.psc.gov.ph/|title=Philippines to Host the 7th BIMP-EAGA Friendship Games|publisher=7th BIMP-EAGA Friendship Games|year=2012|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The former Philippine President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] proposed the said subregional economic co-operation initiative between the border areas of 
[[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]] in order to accelerate the economic development between these countries. The planned cooperation came to fruition with the foundation of [[BIMP-EAGA]] in March 24, 1994.
The first friendship game was inaugurated in [[General Santos City]], [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]] in April 25‚Äì27, 1996. Subsequently, the second friendship games were held at [[Kuching]], [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] in October 24‚Äì26, 1997. The friendship games was in hiatus for 5 years and only made a comeback in [[Puerto Princesa City]], [[Palawan]], [[Philippines]] on April 23‚Äì26, 2003.

The '''Indigenous Peoples' Games''' (Portuguese: '''Jogos dos Povos Ind√≠genas''') are a Brazilian [[multi-sport]] event for [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous peoples]], founded in 1996 by the [[Inter Tribal Council]] (ITC)  with the support of the [[Ministry of Sports (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of Sports]]. The first event was held in [[Goiania]], capital of the State of [[Goias]]. The chief organiser of the sporting, traditional, cultural and spiritual side of the Games is the indigenous leader, President and founder of the ITC, [[Marcos Terena]]. His brother, Carlos Terena, is the Executive organiser of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.ceara.gov.br/noticias/noticias_detalhes.asp?nCodigoNoticia=15945 Jogos dos Povos Ind√≠genas - Um sonho que se tornou realidade]&lt;/ref&gt; In total more than 150 Brazilian indigenous groups have participated so far, including the [[Xavante people|Xavante]], [[Bororo people|Bororo]], [[Pareci people|Pareci]] and [[Guarani people|Guarani]] peoples. Some international delegations from [[Canada]] and [[French Guiana]] have also taken part in later editions.

This foreign involvement has grown into the '''[[World Indigenous Games]]''' which will be held in 2015.

==Bid selection==
The host for the European Universities Games 2016 was decided on 1 June 2013 in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], by the EUSA Executive Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bids&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fisu.net/en/European-Universities-Games-2016-and-2018-3133.html?mbID=5254|title= European Universities Games 2016 and 2018|publisher= FISU| date=7 June 2013|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bids were [[Zagreb]] and [[Rijeka]] in Croatia, and [[Coimbra]] in Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bids&quot;/&gt; The Croatian presentation was followed by a questions and answers session, and the same system applied also for the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] delegation with the bidding city of Coimbra, which came next.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016Official&quot;/&gt;

The Croatian delegation was led by [[Gordan Kozulj]], the Chairman of the Bidding Committee, and other members of the delegation were [[Zeljko Jovanovic]], [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Minister of Science, Education and Sports]];  [[Pero Lucin]], Rector of the [[University of Rijeka]]; Petra Radetic, President of Student Council of the [[University of Zagreb]];  Jelena Pavicic Vukicevic, Deputy Mayor of the [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]] and Zrinko Custonja, the President of the Croatian University Sports Federation (CASF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bids&quot;/&gt; The Portuguese delegation was composed of Mr Ricardo Morgado, the Chairman of the Bidding Committee; Mr Emidio Guerreiro, Secretary of State for Sport and Youth; Mr Joao Gabriel Silva, Rector of the University of Coimbra; Mr Joao Barbosa De Melo, Mayor of Coimbra; Mr Bruno Barracosa, the President of the Academic University Sports Federation of Portugal (FADU) and Mr Tiago Martins, Vice-President of the Students Council of the University of Coimbra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bids&quot;/&gt;

Before the announcement of the winning city was done, EUSA President [[Adam Roczek|Roczek]] stressed the quality of both bids and presentations, and then announced ''&lt;sub&gt;'&quot;The 3rd European Universities Games in 2016 will be organised in: Zagreb-Rijeka in Croatia&quot;''&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref name=&quot;2016Official&quot;/&gt; Coimba in Portugal was later chosen to host the [[European Universities Games 2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eusa.eu/EVENTS/Games/Coimbra-2018|title= European Universities Games Coimbra 2018|publisher=European University Games|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tradition of university sports in Croatia ==
The first student sports club was founded 112 years ago at the University of Zagreb. The Federation of Academic Sports Clubs at the University of Zagreb was founded 92 years ago. Mandatory physical education classes were introduced in Croatian universities 52 years ago. Twenty eight years ago the first University Games, also known as Universiade was organized in Zagreb. The Croatian Academic Sports Federation was founded 22 years ago.
Organized primarily as a cultural and a social event, the [[1987 Summer Universiade|1987 Universiade]] in Zagreb helped bring infrastructural renaissance to the capital city of Croatia and created the prerequisites for the significant advancement of Croatian sport as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eug2016.com/our-inspiration/|title= Our Inspiration|publisher= European University Games|accessdate=27 February 2015|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CW&quot;/&gt;

== Verbal and visual identity of EUG2016 ==

===Verbal identity: motto===

The slogan ''Hearth believes, mind achieves'', proclaims idea of dualism, which is integrated in the very proposal of the dual candidature of Zagreb and Rijeka, and its basic idea is officially explained as follows: &lt;sub&gt;''&quot;The slogan is the basic concept of the synergy of the heart and mind, two mighty organs of great contrast; however only through their joint work it is possible to achieve the proper functioning of the human body. The concept of dualism and synergy of the heart and mind, promote all the key values that student sports represent: ratio, education, prudence, strength, energy, fighting spirit and love ‚Äì characteristics that help young people achieve excellence in their academic and athletic lives. The slogan also rests on the concepts of faith as a motivator, and achievement as a result of the successful sports activity. Both concepts represent important elements of sports ‚Äì faith in one self and one‚Äôs own capabilities, faith in victory, the achievement of results, the worthiness of persistence and in vested effort.&quot;''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Generic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eug2016.com/|title= European Universities Games Zagreb-Rijeka 2016|publisher=European University Games|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Visual identity: logo===
The author of the visual identity is Croatian graphic designer [[Jurica Doliƒá]], who described his solution as follows:
&lt;sub&gt;''&quot;The visual identity embodies the verbal identity aspect by incorporating the symbol of the heart (shape, red colour) and mind (circle, blue colour). It also embodies a number of other symbols which have an exceptional importance for the candidature of Zagreb and Rijeka: Colours ‚Äì red, white and blue are the representative colours of Croatian national symbols. Red is the colour of Rijeka, while blue is the representative colour of Zagreb. Shapes ‚Äì white shapes (inside the blue circle) symbolize the number 16 (year of holding the Games ‚Äì 2016). Furthermore, these shapes denote the silhouette of [[1987 Summer Universiade|‚ÄúZagi‚Äù]] (the exceptionally popular mascot of the Zagreb Universiade from 1987), and in the combination with the red colour of the heart portrays a flame as the symbol of the sporting and Olympic spirit.&quot;''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Generic&quot;/&gt;

===The mascot===
After public voting, the figure of hamster became an official mascote of EUG2016. Final selection of the mascot is the result of the selection process that began in September 2014, after which at an open call 64 applications with mascot suggestions arrived. Nine-member jury selected three finalists that were presented to the public who was offered the opportunity to make a final decision of the EUG 2016 mascot in the second round of the competition. The winning suggestion was the one by Croatian authors [[Vedran Rede]] and [[Matija Tom≈°iƒá]] who created the mascot of hamster, suggesting that it is important to participate and not always to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eug2016.com/maskota-2/|title= Maskota|publisher= European University Games|accessdate=27 February 2015|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">The inaugural '''Gallipoli Games''' is being held in 2015 under the patronage of the Presidency of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. It is being held to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and is intended to be held every two years.

==Background==
The Games have the  motto: ''On the land their ancestors sacrificed their lives 100 years ago, they are now competing for peace.'' &lt;ref name=official/&gt; University students from seven countries - [[Turkey]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[Great Britain]] are eligible to compete. &lt;ref name=official/&gt;  Torch relay commenced in March 2015 and it visited the seven participating countries.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallipoli Games|url=http://www.gallipoligames.com|website=Official website|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University Sports Federation of Turkey is managing the Games and the [[Turkish government|Turkish Government]] has provided funding of [[Turkish lira|TRY]] 50 million.&lt;ref name=ausuni&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia returns to Turkey for Gallipoli Games|url=http://www.unisport.com.au/News/Pages/AustraliareturnstoTurkeyforGallipoliGames.aspx|website=Australia University Sport News,|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Games were due to be held 25-59 April 2005. However, in mid April 2015, the organisers decided to postpone the Games to tie in with the [[International Day of Peace]] on September 21. Games co-chairman Omer Mutlugun said ''the postponement would allow the event to receive due international recognition and better mirror the games‚Äô motto about competing for peace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rabar|first1=Julia|title=Gallipoli Games postponed in shock decision by University Sports Federation of Turkey|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/gallipoli-games-postponed-in-shock-decision-by-university-sports-federation-of-turkey/story-fngnvlxu-1227306473082|accessdate=19 May 2015|work=Waverley Leader|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35111">[[File:Beijing 2008, Beijing National Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] event in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. The [[Olympic Games]], part of the [[Olympic movement]], was the first major, modern, [[multi-sport event]] of international significance.]]

A '''[[multi-sport event]]''' is an organized sporting event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation-states. Events are typically held over a few days to accommodate the large number of events held, often more than those in single-sport competitions. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Some of the most recognised sporting events in the world today are multi-sport events ‚Äî the World Games, the [[Commonwealth Games]], the [[Pan American Games]] and the [[Mediterranean Games]] ‚Äî among others. This article lists all major multi-sport events, whether defunct or functioning, in the modern day. A full listing of all major multi-sport events is provided in the table below.

Transnational multi-sport events are often organised across concords of cultural elements between nations. These include language, such as the [[Francophone Games]] for [[French language|French]]-speaking nations; ethnic, such as the [[Maccabiah Games]] for [[Jewish]] athletes; political, such as the [[Spartakiad]] used to oppose the Olympics; occupation, such as the [[Universiade]] for [[university]] students; and gender, such as [[World Outgames]] for the [[gay]] community. Participation is also delineated across other lines including region, religion, age, and [[season]] (winter instead of summer). A number of multi-sport events are held within nations, where athletes representing various intra-national states or districts compete against each other; these include the [[Thailand National Games]] and the [[National Games of China]]. These differences in intended audiences are highlighted in the table.

== Historical ==
{{Further2|[[History of sport]]}}

Prior to the modern day, there were instances of multi-sport events held centuries or millennia in the past. The [[Tailteann Games]], held near modern [[Telltown]] in [[Ireland]], was one of the first multi-sport festivals to be recorded, with a history that traces back to 1829 BC. There were several other games held in Europe in the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]]. the [[Panhellenic Games]] encompassed the Ancient Olympic Games, which was the precursor to the modern Olympic Games; the [[Pythian Games]]; the [[Nemean Games]]; and the [[Isthmian Games]]. The [[Roman Games]], held in [[ancient Rome]], focused on Greek sports as well as the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] sport of [[gladiator]]ial combat. Other multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in England, the [[Highland games]] in Scotland still in existence today, and the Olympiade de la R√©publique in France in the 19th century.

As these multi-sport events or festivals occurred pre-20th century, when the rules for today's [[History of sport|modern sports]] were largely different or yet to be established, these are not included in the table. The events noted in this section documents all known historical multi-sport events.

== Scope ==
Multi-sport events can be classified by scope. Some cater to international audiences; some to regional audiences; and some are held within nations. These differences are presented in the table as well, in addition to other divisions such as ethnicity and historical origins as described earlier.

Only a few modern multi-sport events cater to international audiences without cultural or political boundaries. The most famous of these is the [[Olympic Games]]. The others are namely the [[World Games]], established to host sports not within [[Olympic sports|the Olympic scope]]; the [[World Mind Sports Games]], which hosts competitions in [[mind sport]]s which are not found in either of the two abovementioned events; the [[X Games]] and the [[Winter X Games]], organised for [[extreme sports|extreme action sports]]; the [[World Combat Games]], for martial arts and combat sports; and the now-cancelled [[Goodwill Games]].

Similarly, there are also regional multi-sport events held that purely cater to regional audiences regardless of cultural and/or political elements. These are often grouped by continent and sub-continental regions. The Asian Games are held for athletes in Asia; the [[Central Asian Games]], the [[East Asian Games]], the [[South Asian Games]] and the [[Southeast Asian Games]] cater to [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] respectively, which are all regions of the Asian continent. In the Americas, the largest multi-sport event that fits the description is the [[Pan American Games]]. The other multi-sport events in the continent are the [[South American Games]], the [[Central American Games]], the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] and the [[Central American Games]].

== List of major multi-sport events ==
The criteria in listing a multi-sport event is as follows: The event should have received significant media coverage where it is covered; national, regional, or international. At the same time, organisation of the event is taken charge by a formal body, with at least one sport in the event sanctioned by an international [[sports federation]] that is recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] or the [[General Association of International Sports Federations]] (GAISF).

[[File:Highland Games-Opening ceremonies in Canmore.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies of 2004 [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]] Highland games]]

'''Highland games''' are events held in spring and summer in [[Scotland]] and other countries as a way of celebrating Scottish and [[Celt]]ic culture and, especially that of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Certain aspects of the games are so well known as to have become emblematic of Scotland, such as the [[bagpipes]], the [[kilt]], and the heavy events, especially the [[caber toss]]. While centred on competitions in piping and drumming, dancing, and Scottish heavy athletics, the games also include entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of Scottish and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture.

The [[Cowal Highland Gathering]], better known as the ''Cowal Games'', held in [[Dunoon]], [[Scotland]], every August, is the largest Highland games in the world,{{ref|Cowal}} attracting around 3,500 competitors and somewhere in the region of 23,000 spectators&lt;ref name=CHG1&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowal Highland Gatcitationhering|url=http://www.cowalgathering.com/spectators.php|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from around the globe. Worldwide, however, it is exceeded in terms of spectators by two gatherings in the United States: the estimated 30,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grandfather Mountain Highland Games Fast Facts|url=http://www.grandfather.com/about-grandfather-mountain/media/highland-games-press-room/gmhg-fast-facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; that attend [[Grandfather Mountain]] in [[North Carolina]] and the even larger gathering‚Äîthe largest in the Northern Hemisphere&lt;ref name=&quot;Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds|url = http://www.independentnews.com/scottish-games-draw-record-crowds/collection_bd18c91c-5751-11e5-9720-afdde78f41b4.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîthat has taken place every year since 1866 hosted by the Caledonian Club of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 150th Scottish Highland Gathering &amp; Games|url = http://thescottishgames.com|website = thescottishgames.com|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is currently held on Labor Day weekend in [[Pleasanton, California]], and their Sesquicentennial Games held on September 5‚Äì6, 2015, attracted record crowds close to 50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds&quot;/&gt;

The games are claimed to have influenced [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]] when he was planning the [[1896 Summer Olympics#Reviving the Games|revival of the Olympic Games]]. De Coubertin saw a display of Highland games at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7107301.ece|title=Highland games were the model for modern Olympics|date=25 April 2010|publisher=The Times|accessdate=3 May 2010 | location=London | first=Marc | last=Horne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origin of human games and sports predates recorded history. An example of a possible early games venue is at [[Fetteresso Castle|Fetteresso]], although that location is technically a few miles south of the Scottish Highlands.

It is reported in numerous Highland games programs, that King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], in the 11th century, summoned contestants to a foot race to the  summit of Craig Choinnich (overlooking [[Braemar]]).{{ref|Canmore}} King Malcolm created this foot race in order to find the fastest runner in the land to be his royal messenger. Some have seen this apocryphal event to be the origin of today's modern Highland games.{{ref|origins}}

There is a document from 1703 summoning the [[Scottish clan|clan]] of the Laird of Grant, [[Clan Grant]]. They were to arrive wearing Highland coats and &quot;also with [[long gun|gun]], [[sword]], [[pistol]] and [[dirk]]&quot;.{{ref|Grant}} From this letter, it is believed that the competitions would have included feats of arms.

However, the modern Highland games are largely a Victorian invention, developed after the [[Highland Clearances]].

===Heavy events===
[[File:Caber 2.jpg|thumb|A caber being thrown at the 2000 [[New Hampshire]] Highland Games]] In their original form many centuries ago, Highland games revolved around athletic and sports competitions. Though other activities were always a part of the festivities, many today still consider Highland athletics to be what the games are all about‚Äîin short, that the athletics are the Games, and all the other activities are just entertainment. Regardless, it remains true today that the athletic competitions are at least an integral part of the events and one‚Äîthe caber toss‚Äîhas come to almost symbolize the Highland games.

Although quite a range of events can be a part of the Highland athletics competition, a few have become standard.

* [[Caber toss]]: A long tapered pine pole or log is stood upright and hoisted by the competitor who balances it vertically holding the smaller end in his hands (see photo). Then the competitor runs forward attempting to toss it in such a way that it turns end over end with the upper (larger) end striking the ground first. The smaller end that was originally held by the athlete then hits the ground in the 12 o'clock position measured relative to the direction of the run. If successful, the athlete is said to have turned the caber. Cabers vary greatly in length, weight, taper, and balance, all of which affect the degree of difficulty in making a successful toss. Competitors are judged on how closely their throws approximate the ideal 12 o'clock toss on an imaginary clock.
* [[Stone put]]: This event is similar to the modern-day [[shot put]] as seen in the Olympic Games. Instead of a steel shot, a large stone of variable weight is often used. There are also some differences from the Olympic shot put in allowable techniques. There are two versions of the stone toss events, differing in allowable technique. The &quot;Braemar Stone&quot; uses a 20‚Äì26&amp;nbsp;lb stone for men (13‚Äì18&amp;nbsp;lb for women) and does not allow any run up to the toeboard or &quot;trig&quot; to deliver the stone, i.e., it is a standing put. In the &quot;Open Stone&quot; using a 16‚Äì22&amp;nbsp;lb stone for men (or 8‚Äì12&amp;nbsp;lb for women), the thrower is allowed to use any throwing style so long as the stone is put with one hand with the stone resting cradled in the neck until the moment of release. Most athletes in the open stone event use either the &quot;glide&quot; or the &quot;spin&quot; techniques.
* [[Scottish hammer throw]]: This event is similar to the [[hammer throw]] as seen in modern-day track and field competitions, though with some differences. In the Scottish event, a round metal ball (weighing 16 or 22&amp;nbsp;lb for men or 12 or 16&amp;nbsp;lb for women) is attached to the end of a shaft about 4 feet in length and made out of wood, bamboo, rattan, or plastic. With the feet in a fixed position, the hammer is whirled about one's head and thrown for distance over the shoulder. Hammer throwers sometimes employ specially designed footwear with flat blades to dig into the turf to maintain their balance and resist the centrifugal forces of the implement as it is whirled about the head. This substantially increases the distance attainable in the throw.

[[File:Weight throw, 2002 Celtic Festival.jpg|thumb|Weight throw]]
* [[Weight throw]], also known as the weight for distance event. There are actually two separate events, one using a light (28&amp;nbsp;lb for men and 14&amp;nbsp;lb for women) and the other a heavy (56&amp;nbsp;lb for men, 42&amp;nbsp;lb for masters men, and 28&amp;nbsp;lb for women) weight. The weights are made of metal and have a handle attached either directly or by means of a chain. The implement is thrown using one hand only, but otherwise using any technique. Usually a spinning technique is employed. The longest throw wins.
* [[Weight over the bar]], also known as weight for height. The athletes attempt to toss a 56-pound (4-stone) weight with an attached handle over a horizontal bar using only one hand. Each athlete is allowed three attempts at each height. Successful clearance of the height allows the athlete to advance into the next round at a greater height. The competition is determined by the highest successful toss with fewest misses being used to break tie scores.
* [[Sheaf toss]]: A bundle of straw (the sheaf) weighing 20 pounds (9&amp;nbsp;kg) for the men and 10 pounds (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) for the women and wrapped in a burlap bag is tossed vertically with a pitchfork over a raised bar much like that used in pole vaulting. The progression and scoring of this event is similar to the Weight Over The Bar. There is significant debate among athletes as to whether the sheaf toss is in fact an authentic Highland event. Some argue it is actually a country fair event, but all agree that it is a great crowd pleaser.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
* '''Maide Leisg''' (Scots Gaelic meaning 'Lazy Stick'): Trial of strength performed by two men sitting on the ground with the soles of their feet pressing against each other. Thus seated, they held a stick between their hands which they pulled against each other until one of them was raised from the ground. The oldest 'Maide Leisg' competition in the world takes place at the Carloway show and Highland Games on the Isle of Lewis.

Many of the Heavy Events competitors in Scottish highland athletics are former high school and college track and field athletes who find the Scottish games are a good way to continue their competitive careers.

Increasingly in the USA, the Heavy Events are attracting women and master class athletes which has led to a proliferation of additional classes in Heavy Events competitions. Lighter implements are used in the classes.

===Music===
[[File:Massed Bands, 2005 Pacific Northwest Highland Games.jpg|thumb|Massed bands at the 2005 [http://www.sshga.org Pacific Northwest Highland Games]]]

[[File:Pipeband circle.JPG|thumb|Highland Pipeband Competition Circle [Prince Charles Pipe Band 2008]]]
For many Highland games festival attendees, the most memorable of all the events at the games is the massing of the pipe bands. Normally held in conjunction with the opening and closing ceremonies of the games, as many as 20 or more pipe bands will march and play together. The result is a thunderous rendition of ''[[Scotland the Brave]]'' or ''[[Amazing Grace]]'', and other crowd-pleasing favourites.

It is, in fact,  the music of the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpipe]] which has come to symbolize music at the Games and, indeed, in [[Scotland]] itself. In addition to the massed bands, nearly all Highland games gatherings feature a wide range of piping and drumming competition, including solo piping and drumming, small group ensembles and, of course, the pipe bands themselves.

Music at Highland games gatherings also includes other forms, such as [[fiddle|fiddling]], [[harp]] circles and [[Celt]]ic bands, usually spiced with a large amount of bagpipe music.

===Dance===
The [[Cowal Highland Gathering]] hosts the annual World Highland Dancing Championship. This event gathers the best competitive dancers from around the world who compete for the [[Highland dancing#Organization|SOBHD]] sanctioned World Championship title.

===Secondary events and attractions===

[[File:2005 Tacoma Highland Games.jpg|thumb|Assembling for the parade of clans at the 2005 [http://www.tacomagames.org Tacoma Highland Games]]]

At modern-day Highland Games events, a wide variety of other activities and events are generally available. Foremost among these are the [[Scottish Clan|clan]] tents and vendors of Scottish related goods. The various clan societies make the Highland games one of the main focus of their seasonal activities, usually making an appearance at as many such events as possible. Visitors can find out information about the Scottish roots and can become active in their own clan society if they wish.

At modern games, armouries will display their collections of swords and armour, and often perform mock battles. Various vendors selling Scottish memorabilia are also present selling everything from [[Irn-Bru]] to the stuffed likeness of the [[Loch Ness Monster]].

[[Herding dog]] trials and exhibitions are often held, showcasing the breeder's and trainer's skills. In addition, there may be other types of Highland animals present, such as the [[Highland cattle]].

Various traditional and modern [[Celts|Celtic]] arts are often showcased. This could include Harper's circles, [[Scottish country dancing]], and one or more entertainment stages. In addition, most events usually feature a pre-event ceilidh (a type of social event with traditional music, dancing, song, and other forms of entertainment).

Various food vendors will also offer assorted types of traditional Scottish refreshment and sustenance.

# {{note|origins}} Many Highland games web sites contain a brief sketch on the history of the Highland games. Most will mention this hill climb, some referring to it as a story or legend, others as if it were an established fact. Webster, in ''Scottish Highland Games'' recounts the story, labelling it as story, or legend only. Thomas Owen Clancy and Barbara E. Crawford, in the Bibliographical essay to chapter 2 (The Formation of the Scottish Kingdom) of ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' state: &quot;Little of significance has been written about the eleventh century kingdom otherwise, except on the dispute over the reliability of the early documentary sources. . .&quot;.

An article published in 2004 in the [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0519/p01s04-woeu.html Christian Science Monitor] points to two other events, including that of Much Wenlock, a small English village in Shropshire

The '''Olympic Games'''  ({{lang-grc-gre| ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ}}, &quot;Olympiakoi Agones&quot;) were a series of [[Athletics (sport)|athletic competition]]s among representatives of [[polis|city-state]]s and one of the [[Panhellenic Games]] of [[Ancient Greece]]. They were held in honor of [[Zeus]], and the Greeks gave them a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] [[aition|origin]]. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC.{{cn|date=May 2016}} They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]], until the emperor [[Theodosius I]] suppressed them in 394&amp;nbsp;AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of Rome]]. The games were held every four years, or ''[[olympiad]]'', which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.

During the celebration of the games, an [[Olympic Truce]] was enacted so that athletes could travel from their countries to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations and artistic competitions. The [[statue of Zeus at Olympia]] was counted as one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]]. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.

The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,&lt;ref&gt;David Sansone, ''Ancient Greek civilization'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; although a woman, [[Bilistiche]], is also mentioned as a winning chariot owner. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek [[List of ancient Greek cities|city-state]] and kingdom were allowed to participate, although the [[Hellanodikai]], the officials in charge, allowed king [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]] to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Malcolm Errington, ''A history of Macedonia'', University of California Press, 1990, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington, ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The games were always held at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] rather than alternating to different locations as is the tradition with the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=perseus&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ancient Olympics|publisher=Tufts University|work=The Perseus Project|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics|accessdate=12 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210170341/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics| archivedate= 10 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.

==Origins==
[[File:Olympos.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's impression of ancient Olympia]]
To the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, pp.101‚Äì102&lt;/ref&gt; These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. According to the story, the [[Dactyl (mythology)|dactyl]] Herakles (not to be confused with the son of [[Zeus]]) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.225‚Äì226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, 5.7.6-9&lt;/ref&gt; The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on [[Mount Olympus]]) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, p.226&lt;/ref&gt;

Another myth of the origin of the games is the story of [[Pelops]], a local [[Olympia, Greece|Olympian]] hero. The story of Pelops begins with [[Oenomaus]], the king of [[Pisa, Greece]], who had a beautiful daughter named [[Hippodamia]]. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god [[Poseidon]] and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer [[Myrtilus]] to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the [[Altis]] for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of [[Zeus]]. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and gave his name to the [[Peloponnese]].

One other myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to [[Pindar]]. He claims the festival at Olympia involved [[Herakles]], the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his [[12 Labors|labors]], Herakles established an athletic festival to honor his father.

The games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by [[Lycurgus of Sparta]], [[Iphitos of Elis]], and Cleisthenes of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisa]] at the behest of the [[Oracle of Delphi]] who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, pp.102‚Äì103&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 1999, p.102‚Äì104&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the 160s nbsp;AD, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] of the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] period and later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy J. Raschke|title=Archaeology Of The Olympics: The Olympics &amp; Other Festivals In Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwU1IlTEhrYC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=15 June 1988|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-11334-6|pages=22‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=l582jgEACAAJ&amp;dq=patay+The+origins+of+the+olympic+games&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibnJP-sJrMAhVsD5oKHdVBDtkQ6AEIGzAA|title=The Origins of the Olympic Games|last=Patay-Horv√°th|first=Andr√°s|publisher=Archaeolingua|year=2015|isbn=978-963-9911-72-7|location=Budapest|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in [[Ancient Greece]], the other being the much older religious festival, the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HickokSports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/olancien.shtml |title=The Ancient Olympic Games |publisher=HickokSports |date=4 February 2005 |accessdate=13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070510082340/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/olancien.shtml| archivedate= 10 May 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I see the citation.....but still, something is missing here --&gt;

The games started{{when?|date=May 2016}} in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the [[List of deities|Greek deities]] near the towns of Elis and [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]] (both in [[Elis]] on the peninsula of [[Peloponnesos]]). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, [[Hera]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias: v. 16. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar: Pythian Odes ix&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heraea Games]], the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's ''[[Description of Greece]]'', c. AD&amp;nbsp;175, state that [[Alcathous|Hippodameia]] gathered a group known as the &quot;Sixteen Women&quot; and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to [[Pelops]]. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the &quot;[[Sixteen Women]]&quot; were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[mythology]], Zeus was the father of the deities in the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of that era. The Sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in Olympia housed a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue in ivory and gold of Zeus]] that had been sculpted by [[Phidias]] circa 445&amp;nbsp;BC. This statue was one of the ancient [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]]. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.

The historian [[Ephorus]], who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Numa Pompilius 1.4''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, ''1.74-1-3''. Little remains of Eratosthenes' ''Chronographiae'', but its academic influence is clearly demonstrated here in the ''Roman Antiquities'' by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis Feeney in ''Caesar's Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History''. (Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2007), 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term ''[[Olympiad]]'' for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316&amp;nbsp;BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765&amp;nbsp;BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Athletics of the Ancient Olympics: A Summary and Research Tool&quot; by Kotynski, p.3 (Quote used with permission). For the calculation of the date, see Kotynski footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Alfred Mallwitz's article &quot;Cult and Competition Locations at Olympia&quot; p.101 in which he argues that the games may not have started until about 704 BC. Hugh Lee, on the other hand, in his article &quot;The 'First' Olympic Games of 776 B.C.E&quot; p.112, follows an ancient source that claims that there were twenty-seven Olympiads before the first one was recorded in 776. There are no records of Olympic victors extant from earlier than the fifth century BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StoneSeats.JPG|right|thumb|The &quot;Exedra&quot; reserved for the judges at Olympia on the north embankment of the stadium]]
The only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] who wrote in 175&amp;nbsp;AD., the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' race, a race over about {{convert|190|m}}, measured after the feet of Hercules. The word ''stadium'' is derived from this foot race.

The Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos)&lt;ref&gt;N.Yalouris.1976.The Olympic Games-through the ages.Print&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in 720&amp;nbsp;BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian [[Orsippus]], and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.

Several groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668&amp;nbsp;BC, Pheidon of [[Argos]] was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.

The Olympic Games were part of the [[Panhellenic Games]], four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the [[Pythian Games|Pythian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], and [[Isthmian Games]].

The games were in decline for many years but continued past 385 AD, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David C.

!Additional Information 
|-
|Foot Race
|Runner
|Runner
|When this race was run once across the field it was called a Stade. The race was called a diaulos  when running once across the field and then back to the starting point. Another race was called a Hippicos when the runners ran four Stades in a row.
|-
|Chariot Race
|Rider
|The Owner
|It was possible for the winner to be a woman in official games from early on. This was likely because she was not physically competing, she was just the owner of the chariot. Women, like many athletes of their time, typically came from well known and wealthy families.  
|-
|Discus
|Thrower
|Thrower
|The thrower had  restriction on his method of throwing, and could only throw directly in front of himself. The thrower, like most athletes, had to practice his positioning and was required to position his body in order to properly throw the discus

|-
|Jumping
|Jumper
|Jumper
|The athlete would wear weights to toss his body forward. These were leather bands tied to their arms with weights attached to them. The jumper was required  to land with both feet close together and could not land on all fours. 
|-
|Running with Armor
|Runner
|Runner
|Was called a Hoplite. Consisted of men running in some pieces of armor. These were typically a helmet or shield, not too much or the runner would be weighed down. This event can be seen as an indication to the games being connected to war.

The ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god [[Zeus]], and on the middle day of the games, [[Hecatomb|100 oxen]] would be sacrificed to him.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; Over time Olympia, site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and a temple, built by the Greek architect [[Libon (architect)|Libon]] was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest [[Doric order|Doric]] temples in Greece.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; The sculptor [[Pheidias]] created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood {{convert|42|ft}} tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt; As the historian [[Strabo]] put it, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... the glory of the temple persisted&amp;nbsp;... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.&quot;&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Artistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like [[Myron]]'s ''[[Diskobolos]]'' or ''Discus Thrower''. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Mark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HLORxPo6asUC&amp;pg=PA77 p. 77].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], one of the founders of the modern [[Olympic Games]], wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 2000, pp.3‚Äì4&lt;/ref&gt;  His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in [[Athens]] in [[Olympic Games|1896]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 35 Parthenon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], one of the leading city-states of the ancient world]]
Power in [[ancient Greece]] became centered around the [[city-state]] in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, pp.9‚Äì10&lt;/ref&gt; These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 2006, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Raschke, 1988, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] was founded c. 630&amp;nbsp;BC by settlers from [[Santorini|Thera]] with [[Sparta]]n support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, [[Greek people|Hellenistic]] culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, 2005, pp.182‚Äì183&lt;/ref&gt;

The games faced a serious challenge during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenistic city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peloponnesian War |last=Lendering |first=Jona |publisher=Livius, Articles on Ancient History |url=http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/peloponnesian_war.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100213095957/http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/peloponnesian_war.html | archivedate=13 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;ref name=thucydides&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Peloponnesian War |last=Thucydides |volume=5 |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.5.fifth.html |others=Translated by [[Richard Crawley]] |isbn=0-525-26035-8 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100213061123/http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.5.fifth.html | archivedate= 13 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Olympic Games, a truce, or ''ekecheiria'' was observed. Three runners, known as ''spondophoroi'' were sent from [[Elis]] to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.&lt;ref name=swaddling11&gt;Swaddling, 1999, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia, wars were suspended, and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.&lt;ref name=swaddling11/&gt; [[Thucydides]] wrote of a situation when the [[Sparta]]ns were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 [[mina (unit)|minae]] for assaulting the city of [[Lepreum]] during the period of the ''ekecheiria''. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.&lt;ref name=thucydides/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strassler &amp; Hanson, 1996, pp.332‚Äì333&lt;/ref&gt;

While a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.&quot;&lt;ref name=perseus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hoplitodromos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1471.jpg|thumb|Athletes running the [[hoplitodromos]]]]
Only free men who spoke [[Greek language|Greek]] were allowed to participate in the Ancient Games of classical times.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They were to some extent &quot;international&quot;, in the sense that they included athletes from the various Greek city-states. Additionally, participants eventually came from Greek colonies as well, extending the range of the games to far shores of the [[Mediterranean]] and of the [[Black Sea]].

To be in the games, the athletes had to qualify and have their names written in the lists. It seems that only young people were allowed to participate, as the Greek writer [[Plutarch]] relates that one young man was rejected for seeming overmature, and only after his lover, who presumably vouched for his youth, interceded with the King of Sparta, was he permitted to participate. Before being able to participate, every participant had to take an oath in front of the statue of [[Zeus]], saying that he had been in training for ten months.

Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] events. In 396&amp;nbsp;BC, and again in 392&amp;nbsp;BC, the horses of a [[Sparta]]n princess named [[Cynisca]] won the four-horse race.

The winner of an Olympic event was awarded an [[olive wreath|olive branch]] and often was received with much honour throughout Greece, especially in his home town, where he was often granted large sums of money (in Athens, 500 [[drachma]], a small fortune) and prizes including vats of [[olive oil]]. (See [[Milo of Croton]].) Sculptors would create statues of Olympic victors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ageladas]]&lt;/ref&gt; and poets would sing odes in their praise for money.

Originally, athletes competing in the Olympic Games wore [[Loincloth|loin-cloths]] covering their genitals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford 1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Archaic and Classical Greece: A Selection of Ancient Sources in Translation |last= Crawford |first= Michael H. |year= 1983 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 9780521296380 |quote= For originally, even in the Olympic Games, athletes competed with loin-cloths covering their genitals, and it is not many since the practice ceased. |page=172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this item of clothing was however phased out and eventually athletes competed in the nude. The athletes usually competed [[nude]], not only because the weather was appropriate, but also as the festival was meant to celebrate, in part, the achievements of the human body.  [[Olive oil#History|Olive oil]] was used by the competitors, not only as a substitute for [[soap]] for washing, bathing, and cleaning, but also as a natural [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]], to keep skin smooth, and provide an appealing look for the participants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Because the men competed nude, married women were forbidden to watch the Olympics under penalty of death.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.penn.museum/sites/olympics/olympicsexism.shtml The Women: Were the Ancient Olympic Games Just for Men?&quot;]. ''Penn Museum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, in [[Sparta]]‚Äîwhich, compared to [[Athens]], was less restrictive to its female citizens in general‚Äîboth men and women did exercise unclothed.

===Running events===
At first, the Olympic Games lasted only one day, but eventually grew to five days. The Olympic Games originally contained one event: the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' (or &quot;stade&quot;) race, a short sprint measuring between {{convert|180|and|240|m}}, or the length of the stadium. The length of the race is uncertain, since tracks found at archeological sites, as well as literary evidence, provide conflicting measurements. Runners had to pass five stakes that divided the lanes: one stake at the start, another at the finish, and three stakes in between.

[[File:Ancient Olympic Starting Line.JPG|thumb|A section of the stone starting line at Olympia, which has a groove for each foot]]

The ''[[diaulos (running race)|diaulos]]'', or two-stade race, was introduced in 724&amp;nbsp;BC, during the 14th Olympic games. The race was a single lap of the stadium, approximately {{convert|400|m}}, and scholars debate whether or not the runners had individual &quot;turning&quot; posts for the return leg of the race, or whether all the runners approached a common post, turned, and then raced back to the starting line.

A third foot race, the ''dolichos'', was introduced in 720&amp;nbsp;BC. Accounts of the race present conflicting evidence as to the length of the ''dolichos''; however, the length of the race was 18‚Äì24 laps, or about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km). The runners would begin and end their event in the stadium proper, but the race course would wind its way through the Olympic grounds. The course often would flank important shrines and statues in the sanctuary, passing by the [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] statue by the temple of [[Zeus]] before returning to the stadium.

The last running event added to the Olympic program was the ''[[hoplitodromos]]'', or &quot;Hoplite race&quot;, introduced in 520&amp;nbsp;BC and traditionally run as the last race of the Olympic Games. The runners would run either a single or double ''[[diaulos (running race)|diaulos]]'' (approximately 400 or 800 yards) in full or partial armour, carrying a shield and additionally equipped either with [[greave]]s or a helmet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilman1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Athletics and Mathematics in Archaic Corinth: The Origins of the Greek Stadion|last=Gilman|first=David|year=1993|isbn=0-87169-206-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HiILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT53|publisher=American Philosophical Society|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrottet1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrottet|first=Tony|title=Let the Games Begin|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2004/august/games.php?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the armour weighed between 50 and {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}}, the ''hoplitodromos'' emulated the speed and stamina needed for warfare. Due to the weight of the armour, it was easy for runners to drop their shields or trip over fallen competitors. In a vase painting depicting the event, some runners are shown leaping over fallen shields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The course they used for these runs were made out of clay, with sand over the clay.

===Additional events===
[[File:Bruttium-Rhegion-coin-478-476-BC.jpg|thumb|310px|In 484 or 480 BC, [[Anaxilas]], [[tyrant]] of [[Rhegium]], won the mule ''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]'' event, and this [[tetradrachm]] was struck in commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/bruttium.html Brutium],&quot; in Barclay Vincent Head, ''Historia Numorum''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Over the years, more events were added: [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxing]] (''pygme''/''pygmachia''), [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] (''pale'') in 708 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHvoM08EYccC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=greek+wrestling+olympic+bc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ya4aUdS_HciLywH6ooD4Cg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greek%20wrestling%20olympic%20bc&amp;f=false|title=Olympic Wrestling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pankration]], a fighting competition combining both elements. Wrestling was also the final decisive event in the ancient pentathlon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympics.mu/ancient-olympic-wrestling.html|title=Rules and styles of Ancient Olympic wrestling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acta-archeo.com/html/4-11793-Pancrace.php|title=ACTA - Pancrace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxing became increasingly brutal over the centuries. Initially, soft leather covered their fingers, but eventually, hard leather with metal sometimes was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576089/Ancient_Olympic_Games.html|title=Boxing gets Brutal |publisher=Encarta|date=23 March 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKLElKO|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fights had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down. Bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died - however, the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner.

Other events include [[chariot racing]], as well as a [[pentathlon]], consisting of wrestling, ''stadion'', [[long jump]], [[javelin throw]], and [[discus throw]] (the latter three were not separate events). In the chariot racing event, it was not the rider, but the owner of the chariot and team who was considered to be the competitor, so one owner could win more than one of the top spots.

The addition of events meant the festival grew from one day to five days, three of which were used for competition. The other two days were dedicated to religious rituals. On the final day, there was a banquet for all the participants, consisting of 100 oxen that had been sacrificed to [[Zeus]] on the first day.

==Olympic festivals in other places==
{{Main|Ancient Greek Olympic festivals}}

Athletic festivals under the name of &quot;Olympic games&quot;, named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at [[Antioch]], obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', 1875'' ‚Äì [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0839.html ancientlibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arab Games''' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÑÿπÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©}}) also called the '''Pan Arab Games''' are a regional [[multi-sport event]] held between nations from the [[Arab world]]. They are organized by the [[Union of Arab National Olympic Committees]]. The first Games took place in 1953 in [[Alexandria]], Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties have made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985.

==History==
The Arab Games were the brainchild of Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the first General Secretary of the [[Arab League]] (1945‚Äì1952). In 1947, Azzam submitted a memorandum to the League, advocating a multi-sport tournament which involved the participation of all Arab countries.

According to Azzam, sport serves as the best way to connect the youth of Arab countries and enable them to build the future of the Arab identity. As a common favorite of young individuals, sports tournaments encourage them to reach out across boundaries, bond with fellow Arabs, and eliminate differences among them. In the same vein, Azzam announced that the youth of the larger Arab nation is eager to gather all the dispersed Arab sports in an annual tournament which will be held in one of the Arab cities.

However, the Arab Games tournament did not gain official approval until 1953, when Ahmed El Demerdash Touny, an Egyptian national and a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), managed to convince the concerned parties within the Arab League that an Arab Games tournament would be instrumental to the overall success of the Arab identity. In response to Touny‚Äôs proposal, the Arab League agreed on establishing the Arab Games, making [[Egypt]] the first country to organise an Arab Games tournament, which was held in the city of [[Alexandria]] from July 26,  ‚Äì August 10, 1953. Eight Arab nations and Indonesia competed in the first Arab Games tournament.

The 2011 Games started in [[Doha]] on December 9 with the Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] inaugurating the event at the [[Khalifa International Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=474966&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
Typically the games are to take place every four years; however, the last Arab Games were held in 2011 and because of the recent events in the Middle East the games have been postponed with no set date in sight. Initially Lebanon was set to host the 2015 XIII Pan Arab Games, but &quot;withdrew because of the crisis in the Middle East&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1023284/pan-arab-games-2015-in-doubt-after-morocco-pull-out-over-financial-fears&lt;/ref&gt; Following Beirut's withdrawal Morocco was then chosen to host the games, but faced financial complications and also withdrew. &quot;[[Mohamed Ouzzine]], Morocco's Minister of Youth and Sports [at the time, wrote to] the [[Union of Arab National Olympic Committees]] (UANOC) telling them that they would be withdrawing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1023284/pan-arab-games-2015-in-doubt-after-morocco-pull-out-over-financial-fears&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Egypt volunteered to host the event. &quot;[[Sheikh Khalid Al Zubair]], chairman of the [[Oman Olympic Committee]] (OOC)&quot; said, &quot;&quot;We will be offering our full support to Egypt and we have also taken a decision to suspend the financial regulations and other requirements due to lack of time.&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1025902/egypt-set-to-host-2015-arab-games-after-two-countries-withdraw&lt;/ref&gt; Had the UANOC accepted Egypt's proposition the games would have taken place in December of 2015; however, no such event was held and there have been no formal statements made in regards to the possibility of future games. 

Because of the current events in the Middle East there is no telling when the next Arab Games will take place or what country may host the games. If the UANOC keeps the same schedule for holding the games every four years the next games could possibly take place in 2019 with an entirely new host country and no reference to the mishap of the 2015 Arab Games.
