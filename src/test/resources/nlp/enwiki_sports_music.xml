      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="345">In the North America sports museums often take the form of a [[hall of fame]], with great emphasis given to the individuals who are honored with membership. This practice is less common elsewhere, but it is beginning to catch on.

[[File:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[physical fitness]] and [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]]

'''Sport''' ([[British English|UK]]) or '''sports''' ([[American English|US]]) are all forms of usually [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] or [[game]]s which,&lt;ref name=sportaccord&gt;{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881|title=Definition of sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, [[entertainment]] for spectators.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web|last=Council of Europe|title=The Europien sport charter|url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]], to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[Season (sports)|sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]]. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.

Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/sports|title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events|publisher=The Olympic Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.&lt;ref name=council/&gt;  However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|title=World Mind Games|url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=SportAccord|title=Members|url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; although limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Sports are usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]].  Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sports betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |work=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while association football is its most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finn|first1=Adharanand|title=Running with the Kenyans|date=2012|page=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangan|first1=J A|title=Sport in Latin American Society: Past and Present|date=2014|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and usage==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;Sport&quot; comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning &quot;[[leisure]]&quot;, with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being &quot;anything humans find amusing or entertaining&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&amp;searchmode=none|title= sport (n.) |accessdate= 20 April 2008|first= Douglas|last=Harper|work= Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|publisher= G&amp;C Merriam Company|location= Springfield, MA|page= 2206|year= 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roget's defines the noun sport as an &quot;activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement&quot; with synonyms including diversion and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|url= http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-618-25414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature===
The singular term &quot;sport&quot; is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. &quot;children taking part in sport&quot;), with &quot;sports&quot; used to describe multiple activities (e.g. &quot;football and rugby are the most popular sports in England&quot;). American English uses &quot;sports&quot; for both terms.

===Definition===
{{see also|Game#Definitions}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The International Olympic Committee recognizes some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]] and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;
* have an element of competition
* be in no way harmful to any living creature
* not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
* not rely on any &quot;luck&quot; element specifically designed into the sport

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[go (game)|go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201|date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term &quot;sport&quot; to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations.

===Competition===
There are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee(IOC) or SportAccord.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Front|first=Rebecca|work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ParentDish|title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their &quot;result&quot; and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with &quot;handicaps&quot; or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

{{Main|History of sport}}

[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]

Artifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm| title= Sports History in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past.  Monuments to the [[Pharaoh]]s indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm| title= Mr Ahmed D. Touny (EGY), IOC Member}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling.  [[Ancient Persia]]n sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to warfare skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10/13/2006&amp;ntype=World| title= Persian warriors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sports that originate in ancient Persia are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

[[File:Bruno Senna 2006 Australian Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Motorsport|Motorized sports]] have appeared since the advent of the modern age]]
[[File:Goście Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Electronic sports]] are a recent development.]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp| title= Ancient Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes — all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportpersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections, p 111, Sarah K. Fields - 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship| publisher= Merriam-Webster|title=Sportsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fish|first1=Joel|last2=Magee|first2=Susan|year=2003|title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent|publisher=Fireside|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=David|date=10 November 2007|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html|title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's &quot;not that you won or lost but how you played the game&quot;, and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: &quot;The most important thing... is not winning but taking part&quot; are typical expressions of this sentiment.

===Cheating===
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure that fair play to occur, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.

Participants may choose to cheat in order to satisfy their desire to win, or in order to achieve an ulterior motive. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates the motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome.

===Doping and drugs===
{{main|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

===Violence===
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.

==Participation==

===Gender participation===

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports|Women's sports in the United States}}
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000).{{Full citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Youth participation===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
Youth sports present children with opportunities for fun, socialization, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sports as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sports is death or serious injury including [[concussion]]. These risks come from running, basketball, football, volleyball, soccer, gymnastics, and ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ &quot;Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007&quot;], ''Time'', 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled participation===

{{see also|Disabled sports}}
'''Disabled sports''' also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''', are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many of these based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

===Spectator involvement===
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast mediums including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of  135 million in India alone  .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM|date = 10 April 2011|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx|newspaper = Hindustan Times|accessdate = 1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html|title= Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history|publisher=Yahoo Sports|date=2 February 2015|accessdate= 8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html| title= Super Bowl most watched television show in US history|work=Financial Times|date=2 February 2015|accessdate= 8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and considerations==

===Amateur and professional===
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rules]] and are highly organized.]]
{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}
Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called &quot;grassroots sport&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;council&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;White Paper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Commission|title=The White Paper on Sport|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm|accessdate=11 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916202200/http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm|archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html|title=Fortunate 50 2011|last=Freedman|first=Jonah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]]. The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practiced a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120–123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoPlease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/spot/olympic-athletes.html| title= Olympic Athletes|publisher= Info Please|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoPlease&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/opinion/greene-olympics-amateurs/| title= What changed the Olympics forever|publisher=CNN|date=23 July 2012|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/13894/olympic-boxing-must-remain-amateur-despite-moves-to-turn-it-professional-states-warren-| title= Olympic boxing must remain amateur despite moves to turn it professional states Warren|publisher= Inside the Games|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=njefAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=only+amateur+boxers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jbCDYw8R1&amp;sig=6_-OvLg15u_iGOSTCS6lxm8dedw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgKahUKEwi6xNfgiI3GAhVRBNsKHf_HAJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20boxers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title= Historical Dictionary of Boxing| last1= Grasso|first1=John|date= 2013|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1529280-olympic-wrestling-is-important-for-pro-wrestlers-and-its-fans| title=Olympic Wrestling Is Important for Pro Wrestling and Its Fans| publisher=Bleacher Report|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2WYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=only+amateur+wrestlers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7VnB9vii1&amp;sig=E0kjCilT-UbvD94prBgV1LIgmSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwB2oVChMI9NP2pomNxgIVoQrbCh2kbQC_#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20wrestlers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false| title= Boys' Life|date=August 1988|page=24|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Technology plays an important part in modern sports. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
 
[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]]. [[Sports engineering]] emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaining Steam in Sports Technology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaining Steam in Sports Technology|url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/|website=Slice of MIT|accessdate=3 January 2015|ref=Slice of MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by [[FINA]], as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm|title=Hi-tech suits banned from January|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 July 2009| accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780| title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers|publisher=ABC News|date=4 January 2010|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, new technology led to the introduction of [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid engines]] in [[Formula One]] in [[2014 Formula One season|2014]], as a way of increasing fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Hybrid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/25158104|title= F1 2014: All aboard the 'power train' - new rules explained|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2014|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars use an energy recovery system similar to, but more effective than, the [[Kinetic energy recovery system#FIA|KERS]] system that was previously used, which recovers energy from braking and the exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.racecar-engineering.com/articles/f1/2014-f1-the-power-unit-explained/|title=2014 F1 explained: The power unit|publisher=Racecar Engineering|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/how-formula-ones-amazing-new-hybrid-turbo-engine-works-1506450399|title= How Formula One's Amazing New Hybrid Turbo Engine Works|publisher=Jalopink|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another innovation is the [[Drag reduction system]], which involves opening a slot in a car's rear wing, to reduce [[aerodynamic drag]] in order to increase [[top speed]] and promote [[overtaking]] in motor racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Drag_Reduction_System.html|title= Drag Reduction System|publisher= Formula One|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in Formula One since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/055CFD424959A061C1257870003A02F0/$FILE/1-2011%20TECHNICAL%20REGULATIONS%2008-03-2011.pdf &quot;2011 F1 Technical Regulations, Section 3.18&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Formula Renault 3.5]] since 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/91777|title=FR3.5 announces 2012 car plans |work=Autosport|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107426 DTM's DRS system will be limited at Brands Hatch – Mattias Ekstrom] – ''Autosport'', 14 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In [[Association football|football]], [[Goal-line technology]] makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FIFA|title=Testing Manual|journal=FIFA Quality Programme for Goal Line Technology|year=2012|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifaqualityprogramme/goal-linetechnology/01/66/02/89/glt_testing_manual_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is not compulsory,&lt;ref name=IFABofficial&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was used in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=4/news=goal-line-technology-set-ahead-fifa-world-cup-2311481.html|title=Goal-line technology set up ahead of FIFA World Cup|date=1 April 2014|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2015/m=3/news=hawk-eye-confirmed-as-goal-line-technology-provider-for-canada-2015-2580727.html |title=Hawk-Eye confirmed as goal-line technology provider for Canada 2015 |date=31 March 2015 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Premier League]] from [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_Premier&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22107409 | title=Goal-line technology: Premier League votes in favour for 2013-14 | publisher=BBC | date=11 April 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bundesliga]] from [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/sports/bundesliga-approves-hawk-eye-goal-line-technology-for-new-season-1.1650074|title=Bundesliga approves Hawk-Eye goal-line technology for new season|work=Carlyle Observer|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[NFL]], a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a [[Challenge (NFL)|challenge]] to review the play using replays.

Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.

[[Benito Mussolini]] used the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in [[Italy]], to showcase [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HWj7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|last1=Kuhn|first1=Gabriel|date=2011|page=28|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World Fascism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA630| title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1|last1= Blamires| first1= Cyprian|date=2006|pages=630–632| accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also used the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], to promote the [[Nazi ideology]] of the superiority of the [[Aryan race]], and inferiority of the Jews and other &quot;[[Untermensch|undesirables]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Fascism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sociology Sport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uKarC6oX3P8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=hitler+used+1936+olympics+to+promote+ideology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6N1Va3pJ-Sa7gaVoICoBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hitler%20used%201936%20olympics%20to%20promote%20ideology&amp;f=false|title= The Sociology of Sport and Physical Education|last1=Saxena |first1= Anurag|year=2001|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kulttuurivihkot 1 2009 Berliinin olympialaiset 1936 Poliittisen viattomuuden menetys Jouko Jokisalo 28-29{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x| title= Sport and apartheid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football|football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

A very famous case when sports and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].

A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/|title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election?|author=Mike Jones|date=3 November 2012|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/|title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football &amp; politics  |work=ESPN Front Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|thumb|right|alt=wheelchair basketball|Wheelchair basketball teams playing in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
'''International sport''' is a [[sport]] in which the participants represent different countries. The most well-known international sports event is the [[Olympic Games]]. Other examples include the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Paralympic Games]].

Modern international sports events can be big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with [[politics and sports]], sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world.

==History==
The ancient [[Olympic Games]] were a series of competitions held between representatives of several [[city-states]] and kingdoms from [[Ancient Greece]], which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games, all struggles between the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2000|edition=2|page=54|isbn=0-292-70373-2|oclc=10759486|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2-HQMnDiLqIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA54,M1|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Olympic Games became a popular global event.

==Economics==
While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such &quot;mega-events&quot; often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Spiegel | first2 = M. M. | year = 2011 | title = The Olympic Effect*. | url = | journal = The Economic Journal | volume = 121 | issue = 553| pages = 652–677 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02407.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern vernacular uses of the word|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. &quot;Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.&quot; ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111–148.].&lt;/ref&gt; The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glynn | first1 = M. A. | year = 2008 | title = Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 1117–1146 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00785.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Globalization]] has continually increased international competition in sports. The [[FIFA World Cup]], for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=700 million to watch World Cup Final |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/ |accessdate=12 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715052728/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/| archivedate= 15 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 A.T. Kearney study of sports teams, leagues and federations, the global sports industry is worth between €350 billion and €450 billion ([[US$]]480-$620 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkearney.com/paper/-/asset_publisher/dVxv4Hz2h8bS/content/the-sports-market/10192  ''The Sports Market'' (2011). A.T. Kearney.]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes infrastructure construction, sporting goods, licensed products and live sports events.

== Olympic Games factor of the globalization of sports ==

=== An international retransmission ===

The Olympics are a major factor in the globalization of sport.
The Olympic symbol is the most recognized symbol in the world even before the logo of Coca-Cola.
The Olympic Games are broadcast around the world. This represents 4.5 billion of people for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Marketing/Broadcasting/Beijing_2008_Global_Broadcast_Overview.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olympic Games globalization===

The Olympic Games have also undergone globalization.
The first Olympic Games of the modern era were held in 1896, only 9 disciplines were present and 241 athletes but only men. The place of women is representative of the position of women in society, and from the first Olympiad 1900 women participated but unofficially. It is in 1920 that the first women were officially part of the Olympic Games.

The number of athletes present at each Olympiad hast been increasing significantly since the first Olympiad:

* In 1886 at the first Olympic games 14 countries were represented by 241 athletes for 43 events;
* 1960 Rome Olympic games have grouped 83 countries for a total of 5338 athletes who competed in 150 different events;
* London 2012, 204 countries were present representing 10,568 athletes for a total of 302 events. However, the gender in number of athletes present is still not achieved in effect on 10568, 5892 were male and 4676 female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Women_in_Olympic_Movement.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Time will tell if this parity is reached.

This category is for [[sports festivals]], or [[festivals]] that focus predominantly on [[sports]] or [[sporting]]. Also referred to as sporting festivals or athletic festivals, some of the earliest recorded sports festivals were the multi-sport [[Panathenaic Games]] and [[Ancient Greek Olympic festivals]], which are also categorized as [[:Category:Multi-sport events|multi-sport events]]. More recent examples of multi-sport festivals include the [[Arirang Festival]] in North Korea.

Other sporting festivals focus on only one sport, such as [[:Category:Mountaineering festivals|mountaineering festivals]], [[:Category:Equestrian festivals|equestrian festivals]], or gymnastics festivals. Sporting festivals focused on transportation sports, like [[motorcycle rallies]], [[:Category:Boat festivals|boat festivals]], [[hot air balloon festival]]s, or [[:Category:Sailing festivals|sailing festivals]], may include attractions such as races, [[air show]]s, [[auto show]]s, or [[boat shows]].

'''Zorbing''' ('''globe-riding''', '''sphereing''', '''orbing''') is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, generally made of transparent plastic.  Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope, but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control.  In the absence of hills some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden or metal ramps. Due to the buoyant nature of the orbs, Zorbing can also be carried out on water, provided the orb is inflated properly and sealed once the rider is inside. 'Water walking' using such orbs has become popular in theme parks across the UK. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHSmCXErI0&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of orbs, harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harness orbs carry up to three riders, while the harness orbs are constructed for one to two riders. Double-harness spheres have different slope requirements, and must only be operated in specific locations.  The longer runs are approximately half a mile. The first zorbing site was established in [[Rotorua]], New Zealand, by David and Andrew Akers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theogo.com/About_History.html | title=History of Zorbing | publisher=Outdoor Gravity NZ Ltd | accessdate =March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Zorbs at the Chew Stoke Harvest Home 2010.jpg|thumb|Zorbing at the [[Chew Stoke]] Harvest Home September 2010]]
Hamster balls, hard plastic single layer spheres made for small rodent pets, have been manufactured and sold since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian article on the Zorb mentions a similar device having debuted in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, the [[Dangerous Sports Club]] constructed a giant [[sphere]] (reportedly {{convert|23|m|0|disp=or}} across) with a [[gimbal]] arrangement supporting two [[deck chair]]s inside.  This device was eventually cut up for scrap, with some of the plastic remnants used to cover a compost heap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human spheres have been depicted in mass media since 1990 when the [[gladiators (television franchise)|Gladiators]] event &quot;Atlaspheres&quot; first aired, albeit with steel balls.

In 1994, Dwane van der Sluis and Andrew Akers conceived the idea for a type of sphere in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], calling their invention the &quot;Zorb&quot;.  With two other investors they created the firm ''ZORB Limited'', and set to work commercializing sphereing.  Their business model was to develop the activity world-wide via a [[franchising|franchise]] system.  In 2000, van der Sluis exited from the company to return to his career as a software engineer; Akers continued to run the company as CEO until April 2006, when he resigned.  Around this time, ZORB's European master franchise operator, Michael Stemp, and Hungarian master franchise operator, Attila Csató, ended their affiliation with ''ZORB'' and started a manufacturing and sphereing consultancy firm, Downhill Revolution &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://downhillrevolution.info
 |title=Downhill Revolution website
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the human cocktail maker called Spinfizz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.spinfizz.com
 |title=SpinFizz website
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Andrew Akers and his brother David Akers have since teamed up with Chris Roberts to create the OGO (Outdoor Gravity Orb) and The Fishpipe.

Sphereing is also referred to as Orbing or Zorbing, and Zorbing entered the Concise [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2001 where it was defined as: &quot;a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills&quot;.

==Construction==
The zorb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer between.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This acts as a [[shock absorber]] for the rider, damping bumps while traveling. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic, as opposed to the rigid plastic, for example, of a [[hamster ball]]. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about {{convert|3|m|0}} in diameter, with an inner orb size of about {{convert|2|m|0}}, leaving a 50–60&amp;nbsp;centimetre (20–24&amp;nbsp;in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately {{convert|0.8|mm|2}} thick.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The inner and outer orb are connected by numerous (often hundreds of) small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.

==Facilities==
Zorbing is performed at commercial locations, where prospective riders pay a fee for each ride or for a whole day's activity.  'Hill-Rolling' (the generic name for this activity) is practiced in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], the middle of [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Australia]] (currently not available), [[North Pole]],
[[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Japan]], [[Kochi]] in [[India]], Phuket in  [[Thailand]] and [[Slovenia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  In the [[United States]], there are facilities in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] (near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park)(permanently closed), [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], and Roundtop Mountain Resort, Lewisberry, Pennsylvania (near [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]]).  Several franchise-based companies (''SphereMania'', ''Orb 360'') as well as ''OGO Inc'', ''Downhill Revolution'' which do not sell franchises but do offer consultancy services and products to suitable operators) have entered the market.

==Records==
The [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] recognises two sphereing records, set over two consecutive days in 2006:
*Longest sphereing ride held by Steve Camp who travelled {{convert|570|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/greatest-distance-zorbing | title= Greatest Distance Zorbing | publisher=Guinness World Records | accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fastest sphereing ride held by Keith Kolver who reached a speed of {{convert|52|km/h|0}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
*Fastest 100m in a Zorb – 26.59 seconds. Held by [[Andrew Flintoff]] who broke the record as part of his attempt to break 12 world records in 12 hours for [[BBC]] [[Sport Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/3/freddie-flintoff-edges-closer-to-guinness-world-record-challenge-target | title= Freddie Flintoff Edges Closer To Guinness World Record Challenge Target | publisher=Guinness World Records | accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries and deaths==
Although the cushioning design of the orbs prevent many serious injuries, light injuries such as bruises and grazes can often be sustained by colliding with objects or tripping whilst the orb is rolling down an incline. Even though severe injury is rare, there have been cases of children passing out due to lack of air &amp; even some deaths. The [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has urged consumers to stop using water walking balls &quot;due to the potential risks of suffocation and drowning&quot;, and reports that several states have banned their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Alert: CPSC Warns of Deadly Danger with Water Walking Balls|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2011/Consumer-Alert-CPSC-Warns-of-Deadly-Danger-with-Water-Walking-Balls/|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 a teacher died and a pupil was seriously injured in the Czech Republic while trying zorbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/teacher-killed-in-zorbing-accident/story-e6frfkp9-1225722279320 | work= News.com.au | title= Teacher killed in zorbing accident | date=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, at a ski resort in [[Dombay, Russia]], a man died from a broken neck and another was seriously injured when a Zorb rolled out of control down a mountain, hitting rocks and eventually coming to a stop a kilometre away on a frozen lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/09/168943032/zorbing-death-brings-call-for-safety-rules-fatal-ride-captured-on-video|work=[[NPR]] | title= 'Zorbing' Death Brings Call For Safety Rules; Fatal Ride Captured On Video| date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Zorb-death-at-Russian-ski-resort/tabid/313/articleID/282433/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Fatal Zorb accident at ski resort| date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/world/europe/zorbing-accident-kills-1-man-and-injures-another-in-russia.html |work=[[New York Times]] | title= Man in Plastic Ball Dies on Russian Ski Slope| date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident was caught on camera and uploaded to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Zorb-death-at-Russian-ski-resort/tabid/313/articleID/282433/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= VIDEO: Zorb death at Russian ski resort| date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident made international headlines, Russian authorities called for tougher safety laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Russia-probes-Zorb-death/tabid/417/articleID/282548/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Russia probes Zorb death| date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the [[connected health]] movement and part of the [[Wearable technology|wearable]], a new segment is quickly growing: the connected sport.
New actors from US and Europe are emerging, offering connected sensors specialized in measuring any specific movement and gesture from specific sports.
Several actors are addressing different sports, such as the 94Fifty Smart Sensor for [[Basketball]], the [[baseball]] sensor from Zepp, the [[Babolat]] and [[PIQ sport|PIQ]] for connected [[tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottkramer/2015/08/28/piq-sensor-improving-your-tennis-game-through-technology/#74aa1f2a1c7f&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/28/babolat-pop-piq-sensors/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2014/07/26/sports-gadgets/#Q6p92gTHcgqk&lt;/ref&gt; or connected ski&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sporttechie.com/2015/12/16/rosssignol-piq-partner-launch-first-connected-ski-offer/&lt;/ref&gt; with Garmin, [[GoPro]] or PIQ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wareable.com/sport/the-best-skiing-gps-watches-hud-goggles-action-cam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport tracker==
A sport tracker or sport sensor, such as the early 2000 Nike+&lt;ref&gt;http://gizmodo.com/5887282/the-next-nike%252B-is-a-futuristic-sensor-that-brings-the-power-of-nikes-research-lab-to-your-shoes&lt;/ref&gt; is a device or application for  measuring athletic ability and monitoring and tracking sport related metrics such as acceleration, speed, velocity, height, air time, G force, amplitude, trajectory, etc. The term describes electronic monitoring devices, such as sport sensors that are synced, in many cases remotely via Bluetooth, to a computer or a smartphone for data tracking and performance measurement. There are also embedded smartphone applications.

==Multi sport sensor==
If most of the sport brands are proposing sensors directly embedded in the sport accessory, a new segment is rapidly emerging with multisport sensors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sporttechie.com/2015/06/29/piq-mobitee-introduce-new-smart-golf-sensor/&lt;/ref&gt; Some connected sensors are specially designed to measure different sport metrics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultofmac.com/405398/multi-sport-sensor-will-help-you-reach-piq-performance/&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the [[PIQ sport|PIQ]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2bcfba68-2a17-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca.html#axzz43w1SQUrm&lt;/ref&gt; multisport sensor is supposed to collect and register all metrics of the sport practice, to measure every movement people make, to digitize performance and to set goals. People wear the sensor at a specific place on their body depending on the kind of sport they practice. For golf&lt;ref&gt;http://connectedworld.com/m2m-solution-transforms-the-golf-game/&lt;/ref&gt; people wear it just under the glove&lt;ref&gt;http://esoutherngolfzine.com/piq-and-mobitee-unveil-new-wearable-technology/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/new-sport-sensors-by-piq/&lt;/ref&gt; and the sensor can also be used to practice ski and tennis and the company claims to address other sports with the same sensor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/start-up/2015/12/14/32004-20151214ARTFIG00086-rossignol-et-piq-lancent-le-premier-capteur-dedie-au-ski.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Athletomics''' is a field of [[omics]] dedicated to the examination of [[genomics]] and [[epigenomics]] variants associated to elite [[athletic]] performance and [[injury]] predisposition.

The first initiative to launch a large collaborative athletomics effort was the establishment of the [http://www.athlomeconsortium.org/ Athlome Project Consortium].

{{Performing arts}}
'''Music''' is an [[art]] form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is [[sound]] and [[silence]]. The common elements of music are [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the &quot;color&quot; of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instrument]]s and with vocal techniques ranging from [[singing]] to [[rapping]], and there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal piece]]s (such as [[song]]s without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; &quot;art of the [[Muses]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.tufts.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as &quot;the [[harmony of the spheres]]&quot; and &quot;it is music to my ears&quot; point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, &quot;There is no [[noise]], only sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260|title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies|last=Kozinn|first=Allen|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=13 August 1992|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, [[performance]], significance, and even the [[definition of music]] vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as &quot;not being music&quot;, including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as [[Classical music]] symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from 20th and 21st century.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genre]]s (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial&lt;!--Is Marilyn Manson goth, industrial or metal?--&gt;. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a [[fine art]] or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or [[orchestra]] performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or [[opera]]), or it may be recorded and listened to on a [[radio]], [[MP3 player]], [[CD player]], [[Smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or [[TV show]].

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., [[graduation]] and [[marriage]]), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, for example, a teen who plays [[cello]] in a [[youth orchestra]], or by working as a professional [[musician]] or [[singer]]. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces, such as [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s; individuals who perform music, which include [[orchestra]], [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and [[conducting|conductors]]; individuals who record music ([[music producer]]s and [[sound engineer]]s) and organize concert tours; and those who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In Greek mythology, the nine muses were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; &quot;art of the [[Muses]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.tufts.edu&quot;/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired [[literature]], [[science]], and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term &quot;music&quot; is derived from &quot;mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] musique (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] musica &quot;the art of music,&quot; also including [[poetry]] (also [the] source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik).&quot; This is derived from the &quot;...Greek mousike (techne) &quot;(art) of the Muses,&quot; from fem. of mousikos &quot;pertaining to the Muses,&quot; from Mousa &quot;Muse&quot; (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term &quot;music&quot; refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=etymonline.com|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an [[entertainment]] product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or [[MP3 player]]. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a &quot;self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). Patterns for College Writing. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. ISBN 978-0-312-67684-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians compose and/or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony [[orchestra]]s, [[broadcasting]] or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as [[freelance]]rs or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community [[orchestra]]s.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both [[classical music]] and in [[popular music]] forms such as [[rock music|rock]], where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album &quot;Hubardo&quot; recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
&quot;Composition&quot; is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western [[classical music]], the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music &quot;score&quot;]], which is then performed by the composer or other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called [[songwriter|songwriting]], may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] her own compositions, but in [[musical theatre]] and in [[pop music]], songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed &quot;interpretation&quot;. Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western [[classical music]], but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|300px|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled &quot;[[Adeste Fideles]]&quot;, in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a &quot;slow blues&quot; or a &quot;fast swing&quot;, which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre. 

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).
 
In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz &quot;[[big band]]s.&quot; In popular music, [[guitar]]ists and electric [[bass guitar|bass]] players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as &quot;tab&quot;), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as &quot;common practice&quot; western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern [[composers]] have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], [[structure]], [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Boretz

==Elements of music==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of &quot;element&quot; being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and USA. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the &quot;elements of music&quot;:

*Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure.&lt;ref&gt;ACARA. (2015). Music glossary.  v7.5. Retrieved 28 May 2015, 2015, from http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/the-arts/music/glossary 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
*UK: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, duration, tempo, structure.&lt;ref&gt;Education.gov.uk. (2011). Music - Schools.   Retrieved 12 July 2013, from http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/primary/b00199150/music&lt;/ref&gt;
*USA: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, rhythm, form, harmony, style/articulation.&lt;ref&gt;NAfME. (2015). Core music standards glossary. http://www.nafme.org/my-classroom/standards/core-music-standards /&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: &quot;appropriate [[musical notation]]s&quot; was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the &quot;elements of music&quot; to the &quot;inter-related dimensions of music&quot;. The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). National curriculum in England: music programmes of study - Publications - GOV.UK. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; and the &quot;perceptual elements of music&quot;.

===Rudimentary elements of music===
In the 1800s, the phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; and the phrase &quot;the rudiments of music&quot; were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). Gestalt phenomena in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase &quot;elements of music&quot; in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: &quot;the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the &quot;inter-related dimensions of music&quot; seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements of music===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four &quot;psychological attributes of sound&quot;. These were: &quot;pitch, loudness, time, and timbre&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the &quot;elements of music&quot; but referred to them as &quot;elemental components&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: &quot;Pitch&quot; and &quot;timbre&quot; match exactly, &quot;loudness&quot; links with dynamics and &quot;time&quot; links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: &quot;a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements align with this list as well.

Writers of lists of &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; vary their lists depending on their personal priorities. However, in relation to the perceptual elements of music, it should be possible to identify a list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of musical styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements of music===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chord]]s. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a [[piano]]  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck. 
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|550px|The melody to the traditional song &quot;[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]&quot;  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a &quot;tune&quot;) is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the &quot;[[white notes]]&quot; on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the &quot;white notes&quot; and &quot;black notes&quot; and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as [[double bass]], [[electric bass]] or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg |thumb|right|200px|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|note]]s at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], including [[classical music]], [[pop music]], [[rock music]] and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the &quot;vertical&quot; sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] (&quot;keys&quot;), which includes most [[classical music]] written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the &quot;home note&quot; or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music [[song]]s are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or &quot;home note&quot; of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
[[Rhythm]] is the arrangement of sounds and silences in [[time]]. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding [[percussion instrument]]. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., [[electric guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], or other [[keyboard instrument]]s), a bass instrument (typically [[electric bass]] or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], [[double bass]]) and a [[drum kit]] player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music: 
*[[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or &quot;tune&quot;) with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
*[[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody, or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments. 
*[[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as &quot;[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]&quot;, which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
*[[homophony]]: a clear melody [[accompaniment|accompanied]] by [[chord (music)|chord]]s. Most Western [[popular music]] [[song]]s from the 19th century onward is written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double [[concerto]] accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a &quot;thicker&quot; or &quot;denser&quot; texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single [[cello]]).

====Timbre or &quot;tone color&quot;====
Timbre, sometimes called &quot;color&quot; or &quot;tone color&quot; is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. &quot;Articulation.&quot; ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], [[piano]], [[violin]] or [[electric guitar]]. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently). 

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]] and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, or emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as [[guitar]], [[violin]], brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

====Form====

In music, [[Musical form|form]] describes how  the overall structure or plan of a [[song]] or piece of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt-Jones|first=Catherine|title=Form in Music|url=http://cnx.org/content/m10842/2.14/|work=Connexions|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandt|first=Anthony|title=Musical Form|url=http://cnx.org/content/m11629/1.13/|publisher=Connexions|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs and [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] songs were often in [[AABA form|AABA]] [[32 bar form]], in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] (&quot;refrain&quot;) sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as &quot;a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]]. 
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Alfred|title=The Study of Fugue|year=1958|publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as &quot;sectional, developmental, or variational.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keil|first=Charles|title=Urban blues|year=1966|isbn=0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wennerstrom|first=Mary|editor=Wittlich, Gary|title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music|year=1975|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=0-13-049346-5|chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music|ref= CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
{{Main|Strophic form}}
This form is defined by its &quot;unrelieved repetition&quot; ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of &quot;unrelieved variation&quot;: it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the [[musical theatre]] show or [[opera]] to come.

;Binary form
{{Main|Binary form}}
[[Image:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p.50. ISBN 0-13-033233-X.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century western classical music, &quot;simple binary&quot; form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.

;Ternary form
{{Main|Ternary form}}
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. &quot;repeat from the top&quot;) form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the &quot;middle eight&quot;. A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
{{Main|Rondo form}} 
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called &quot;episodes&quot;. It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a &quot;development&quot; of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
{{Main|Variation (music)}}
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only &quot;section&quot; and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A,B,A,F,Z,A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] - a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
{{Main|Musical development}}
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the &quot;A&quot; parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the &quot;B&quot; part (the [[musical development|development]]) - thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though nineteenth-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites. [[Paleolithic flutes|Flutes]] are often discovered, carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the Japanese [[shakuhachi]]. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old.

[[Asian music]] covers the music cultures of [[Arabic music|Arabia]], [[Central Asian music|Central Asia]], [[East Asian music|East Asia]], [[South Asian music|South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asian music|Southeast Asia]]. [[Chinese classical music]], the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over around three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music. [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] is the music of [[Iran|Persia]] and Persian language countries: ''musiqi'', the science and art of music, and ''muzik'', the sound and performance of music (Sakata 1983).

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a &quot;social phenomenon called [[litany]],&quot; a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, &quot;Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:&quot;&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html &quot;A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional&quot;]{{dead link|date=March 2015}} ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the &quot;father of all such as handle the harp and pipe,&quot; the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. &quot;One finds in the biblical text,&quot; writes Alfred Sendrey, &quot;a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.&quot; This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul.&quot;&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

===Antiquity===
Major ancient [[Western culture]]s have had a major influence on the development of music. The history of music in Western cultures can be traced back to Ancient Greek times. Ancient Greek society produced the first Western [[philosopher]]s, some of whom wrote theories about music. Music was an important part of Ancient Greek culture, and in turn, influenced the Ancient Roman culture.

===Ancient Greece===
Music was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. Musicians and [[singer]]s played a prominent role in [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theater]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Savage, Roger.

[[music of Greece|Music]] was an important part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development. Greek [[music theory]] included the Greek [[musical mode]]s, that eventually became the basis for Western [[religious music|religious]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music. Later, influences from the [[Roman Empire]], [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]] changed Greek music. The [[Seikilos epitaph]] is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world.

The first work written on the subject of music theory is ''[[Elementa harmonica|Harmonika Stoicheia]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TseQjV_wogC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=translations+of+Aristoxenus+Elements+of+Harmony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aDzoOJl1aD&amp;sig=n4ldPcu--zEZ_Kzxv_8MuCe73oY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dL5GVcH6JdjiasmTgPgM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=translations%20of%20Aristoxenus%20Elements%20of%20Harmony&amp;f=false|author=Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran|title=Harmonika Stoicheia (The Harmonics of Aristoxenus)|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag 1902 ISBN 3487405105|accessdate=4 May 2015}}(and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/aristoxenoy-armonika-stoicheia-the-harmonics-of-aristoxenus/oclc/123175755 World Cat])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|150 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c. 1310–1320]]
The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Allegory of Music, by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, [[composer]]s wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers.

Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]) were written and when [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, independent melody lines were used, became prevalent. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s, [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title= ''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D. |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel]],   [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Vivaldi]].

[[File:Mozart family crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (seated at the keyboard) was a [[child prodigy]] virtuoso performer on the [[piano]] and [[violin]]. Even before he became a celebrated composer, he was widely known as a gifted performer and improviser.]]
The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with [[Classical music]] in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the fifth century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern [[piano]], replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main [[keyboard instrument]]. 

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and [[orchestra]] became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the [[nineteenth century]] had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop [[opera]] and [[ballet]] music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound &quot;colours&quot;. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the [[orchestra]], and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public [[concert]]s became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th- and 21st-century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}
[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]
In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which [[middle class]] amateur music lovers would perform at home on their [[piano]] or other common instruments, such as [[violin]]. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and [[upper class]] people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments. In the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear [[opera]]s, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for [[classical music]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on [[rock music]], because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their [[music producer]] could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, [[rock music]] did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in [[African American]] communities in the [[Southern United States]] from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and [[Europe]]an music traditions. The style's [[West Africa]]n pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; From its early development until the present, jazz has also incorporated music from 19th- and 20th-century [[American popular music]].&lt;ref&gt;Bill Kirchner, ''The Oxford Companion to Jazz'', Oxford University Press, 2005, chapter two.&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz has, from its early-20th-century inception, spawned a variety of subgenres, ranging from [[New Orleans]] [[Dixieland]] (1910s) to 1970s and 1980s-era [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]].

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 - Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the [[electric guitar]] or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|organ]], [[piano]], or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, [[saxophone]] and blues-style [[harmonica]] are used as soloing instruments. In its &quot;purest form,&quot; it &quot;has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d32|pure_url=yes}} allmusic – Rock and Roll]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it branched out into different subgenres, ranging from [[blues rock]] and [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]], as well as the more classical influenced genre of [[progressive rock]] and several types of [[experimental rock]] genres.

==Performance==

Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a [[song]] is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a [[composer]] and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)–which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a [[conducting|conductor]]. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the [[bandleader]]. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of [[solo (music)|solo]] performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical [[music festival]]s or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song &quot;[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]&quot;. When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as &quot;traditional&quot; or as a &quot;folk song&quot;. Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|200px|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an &quot;ornament&quot; is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th century, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this &quot;expressive&quot; performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

In [[popular music]] and jazz, music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody, harmony, or performance approach; musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces. For example, the &quot;[[lead sheet]]&quot; for a jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord changes. The performers in the [[Jazz band|jazz ensemble]] are expected to know how to &quot;flesh out&quot; this basic structure by adding ornaments, improvised music, and chordal accompaniment.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano.]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of [[philosophy]]. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;Graci, C. (2009–2010) A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena. ''Journal of Educational Technology Systems'', 38(2), 181-211.&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. &quot;Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure,&quot; in Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{Main|Psychoacoustics}}
{{Further|Hearing (sense)}}
Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of [[sound]] perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology concerns the &quot;origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution&quot;, and &quot;music evolution and human evolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown, Merker, Wallin&quot;&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): &quot;An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology.&quot; In: Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (Eds., 1999): ''The Origins of Music'', pp. 5–6. ISBN 0-262-23206-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of [[evolutionary theory]]. [[Charles Darwin]] speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a [[protolanguage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=[[Charles Darwin]]|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dscmn10.txt}} Chapter III; Language&lt;/ref&gt; a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Music|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |author=Nils L.

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's [[culture]] or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]]. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soley 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soley|first=G.|last2=Hannon|first2= E.

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. &quot;The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene.&quot; in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. Pages 31-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball, [http://dr.archives.pdx.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/psu/4714/Ball_psu_0180E_10052.pdf?sequence=1, 2010 Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a &quot;[[high culture]]&quot; and &quot;[[low culture]].&quot; &quot;High culture&quot; types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced &quot;art music&quot; from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or [[social class]] of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-&quot;art&quot; music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky [[ballet]] scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the [[sociology]] of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|300px|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several [[mass media|media]]; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the [[radio]], [[television]] or the [[Internet]], or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or [[Mp3 player]]. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played &quot;live.&quot; Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered &quot;better&quot; than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder [[piano]] and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php American Federation of Musicians/History]{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s live musical performances by orchestras, [[pianist]]s, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled &quot;Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ &quot;Canned Music on Trial&quot;] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a [[music video]], became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[disc jockey]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. [[Computer]]s and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===
[[File:YouTube Presents Taylor Swift 15.jpg|thumb|right|160px|YouTube presents pop singer [[Taylor Swift]].]]
The advent of the [[Internet]] and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. ISBN 1-4013-0237-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]], a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to [[MP3]]s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a &quot;[[prosumer]]&quot; role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Business==
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s who create new [[song]]s and musical pieces, [[music producer]]s and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, [[record label]]s and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are &quot;[[independent record label|independent]],&quot; while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on [[MP3 player]]s, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Suzuki violin recital with students of varying ages.]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and [[cooperation]] while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In [[elementary school]]s, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, [[jazz band]]s, or [[orchestra]]s. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

His bass has a low C extension with a metal &quot;machine&quot; with buttons for playing the pitches on the extension.]]
Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, [[music teacher]]s and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by [[college]]s, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, [[conducting]]. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in [[classical music]], there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and [[YouTube]] &quot;how-to&quot; videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.
====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the [[Master of Arts]], the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology. 

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university [[professor]]s in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.
====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, &quot;do animals have music?&quot; [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of &quot;ornitho-musicology&quot; using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that &quot;in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.&quot;

====Ethnomusicology====

In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as [[classical music]]. The history of music in non-Western cultures (&quot;[[world music]]&quot; or the field of &quot;ethnomusicology&quot;), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for [[propaganda]] purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or &quot;art&quot; music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music]]-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these &quot;big two&quot; classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic &quot;[[melting pot]]&quot; society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both [[opera]] and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A music therapist from a &quot;Blues in the Schools&quot; program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which the therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical handicaps, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to: improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872 – 950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the [[therapeutic]] effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Amber Haque (2004), &quot;Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists,&quot; Journal of Religion and Health 43 (4): 357–377 [363]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, &quot;Music a Remedy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an &quot;excellent power ...to expel many other diseases&quot; and he called it &quot;a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.&quot; He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to &quot;make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are
troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

Samved released their first single Kama Unit under the label [[Universal Music Group]] in early 2014. The video for the song was ''first of its kind in the world''. The director of the video, [[Shekhar Karalkar]], combined [[light painting]] and [[stop motion]] for the first time for a music video.&lt;ref&gt;http://lightpaintingphotography.com/light-painting-photography/samved-kama-unit/&lt;/ref&gt; The video was well received and earned the band recognition in the Indie Music space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoopwhoop.com/inothernews/underrated-indian-bands-you-should-definitely-listen-to/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music Style==

Samved's musical style is Electro Classical Fusion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid-day.com/articles/edm-from-india-should-have-indian-flavour/15345159&lt;/ref&gt; Their music is a blend of Upbeat Industrial [[Electronica]] and [[Hindustani Classical]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid-day.com/articles/hindustani-meets-electronica/15334152&lt;/ref&gt; The band draws its inspiration from fusion acts like [[Anand Shankar]] and [[Talvin Singh]]. The band's name &quot;Samved&quot; is inspired for one of the four Vedas [[Samaveda]]. Samaveda is the Veda of Melodies and Sounds. The Indian Classical music and dance considers the melodies in [[Samaveda]] as one of its roots. Their logo is an ancient Indus valley dancing and performing arts symbol.
