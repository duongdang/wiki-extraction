The '''Amirante Islands''' (''Les Amirantes''), a group of coral islands and [[atoll]]s, belong to the [[Outer Islands (Seychelles)|Outer Islands]] of the [[Seychelles]].

They stretch about 155&amp;nbsp;km from the [[African Banks]] (African Islands) in the north to [[Desnoeufs Island|Desnœufs]] (Isle des Noeufs) in the south, all on the shallow [[Amirantes Bank]] (Amirantes Plateau, with depths of mostly 25 to 70 m), except the main island [[Desroches Island|Île Desroches]] in the east, and submerged [[Lady Denison-Pender Shoal]] at the northern end. 90&amp;nbsp;km south of the Amirante Islands is [[Alphonse Group]], the closest group of islands, which are sometimes incorrectly considered part of the Amirantes.

==History==
The Amirantes were discovered by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|second voyage]] of exploration in 1502, and named &quot;Ilhas do Almirante&quot; (Admiral Islands). Previous knowledge of the islands by Arab and Indian traders is possible. Along with the Seychelles, the islands were first claimed by [[France]] in 1742. Formal possession was asserted in 1756. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]], the islands were passed officially to the British, as a part of [[Mauritius]]. In 1909, the [[Seychelles]] became a separate colony, thereby including the Amirantes. On November 8, 1965, the United Kingdom split [[Desroches Island|Île Desroches]] from the Seychelles to become part of the newly created [[British Indian Ocean Territory]]. The purpose was to allow the construction of a military base for the mutual benefit of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. On June 23, 1976, [[Desroches Island|Île Desroches]] was returned to the Seychelles as a result of it attaining independence.

The total land area is 11.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total population is 300. 
The biggest concentrations are the [[Marie Louise Island|Prison]] 2&amp;nbsp;km from [[Marie Louise Island|Marie Louise village]] and the [[Desroches Island|Collins group construction camp]] which is 2&amp;nbsp;km from the capital village of [[Desroches Island|Desroches village]] (which had a population of 35 in the last census).

==Islands==
There are eight single islands (five low sand cays and three uplifted sand cays), plus three atolls with a total of 18 islets (St. Joseph Atoll with 14, Desroches with 1, Poivre Atoll with 3). In addition to these 11 units, the following table also has entries for a reef and a shoal without islets, for the sake of completeness. The five largest ones in area are inhabited. The different island types are marked by different background colours in the table.

===Alphonse Group===
90&amp;nbsp;km south of the Amirante Islands is [[Alphonse Group]], the closest group of islands, which are sometimes incorrectly considered part of the Amirantes chain because they appear as a southern continuation or extension of the Amirantes chain. Alphonse Group lies however clearly south of the Amirantes Bank, separated from it by deep water (generally 1000 to 2000 metres deep).

The '''Dahlak Archipelago''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: ዳህላክ) is an [[island group]] located in the [[Red Sea]] near [[Massawa]], [[Eritrea]]. It consists of two large and 124 small islands. The [[pearl fisheries]] of the [[archipelago]] have been famous since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times and still produce a substantial number of pearls. Only four of the islands are permanently inhabited, of which [[Dahlak Kebir]] is the largest and most populated. Other islands of the archipelago are [[Dhuladhiya]], [[Dissei]], Dohul (Dehil), [[Erwa]], Harat, [[Harmil]], [[Isra-Tu]], [[Nahaleg]], [[Nakura]], [[Nora (island)|Nora]] (Norah) and [[Shumma]], although only Nora and Dohul are permanently inhabited, besides the main island. The islands are home to a diverse [[marine life]] and [[sea-birds]], and attract an increasing number of [[Tourism in Eritrea|tourists]]. Residents of the archipelago speak [[Dahlik language|Dahlik]], an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch. The islands can be reached by boat from Massawa.

==History==
[[File:WELLSTED(1838) p2.937 DHALAC EL KEBEER.jpg|thumbnail|left|185px|Map of the development of the Dahlak Islands (1838).]]
[[G.W.B. Huntingford]] has identified with the Dahlak archipelago a group of islands near [[Adulis]] called &quot;Alalaiou&quot; in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' which were a source of tortoise shell. According to [[Edward Ullendorff]], the Dahlak islanders were amongst the first in the [[Horn of Africa]] to embrace [[Islam]], and a number of tombstones in [[Kufic]] script attest to this early connection.

In the 7th century, an independent Muslim state emerged in the archipelago. However, it was subsequently conquered by [[Yemen]], then intermittently by the Kingdom of [[Medri Bahri]] (Land of the Sea). In 1517 the [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered  the islands and placed them under the rule of the [[Pasha]] at [[Suakin]] as part of the province of [[Habesh]].

The [[Italy|Italian]] colony of [[Eritrea]], formed in 1890, included the archipelago. However, during this time the islands were home to little except the [[Nocra prison camp]] operated by the Italian colonial forces.

After Ethiopia allied itself with the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War, following the rise of the [[Derg]], the Dahlak Archipelago was the location of a [[Soviet Navy]] base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/etsave/et_05_02.html|title=Ethiopia: The Armed Forces|accessdate=2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Ethiopia lost control of the Dahlak Archipelago and the northern Eritrean coast to the Eritrean independence movement ([[EPLF]]) and by 1991 Ethiopia had lost control of all of Eritrea. Following the international recognition of Eritrean independence in 1993, the Dahlak Archipelago became a part of Eritrea.

The '''Farasan Islands''' ({{lang-ar|جزر فرسان}}; [[Arabic transliteration|transliterated]]: {{transl|ar|ALA|Juzur Farasān}}) are a large coral-island group in the [[Red Sea]], belonging to [[Saudi Arabia]]. The islands are located some 40&amp;nbsp;km offshore from [[Jizan]], in the far southwestern part of the country, at {{coord|16|48|N|41|54|E|type:isle_region:SA_dim:200000|display=inline,title}}. The &quot;Farasan island marine sanctuary&quot; is a protected area and were home to the extinct [[Arabian gazelle]] and, in winter, [[migratory birds]] from Europe. The largest island of the archipelago is [[Farasan Island]]; others include [[Sajid Island]] and [[Zufaf Island]].

==Economy==

In 1919, the [[French people|French]] discovered [[petroleum]] on the islands. For 75 years the Red Sea Oilfields Company maintained a refinery on the islands.&lt;ref name=Prothero99&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=99|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/99/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1920, the Farasan Islands supported a small [[fishing]] industry.&lt;ref name=Prothero18&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=18|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/18/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism and fishing also play a role in the economy. Farasan Island is connected to Jezan port by ferry.

The '''Farquhar Group''' belong to the [[Outer Islands (Seychelles)|Outer Islands]] of the [[Seychelles]], lying in the southwest of the island nation, more than {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the capital, [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]] Island.

==Area==
The total land area of all islands in the group is less than {{convert|12.837|km2|abbr=on}}, but the total area of the atolls measures about {{convert|370|km2|abbr=on}}.

The group consists of two [[atoll]]s and one separate [[island]]. In addition, there are a couple of submerged [[reef]]s in the area:
#[[Farquhar Atoll]] (with two larger and about eight smaller islets)
#[[Providence Atoll]] (with 2 islets, Providence Island and Cerf Island)
#[[St. Pierre Island]]
#[[Wizard Reef]]
#[[Umzinto Bank]] (submerged)
#[[Bulldog Bank]] (submerged)
#[[McLeod Bank]] (submerged)

==Population==
There is only one settlement, which is located on Île du Nord (North Island) of [[Farquhar Atoll]]. There is an abandoned village on Providence Island of [[Providence Atoll]].
There are records of [[Maldives|Maldivian]] mariner presence in the group from the 20th century, when a trading vessel from southern Maldives lost its course and reached Providence Atoll.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''. Barcelona 1999, ISBN 84-7254-801-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
The [[Oonopidae|oonopid]] [[Monotypy|monotypic]] spider species ''[[Farqua quadrimaculata]]'' is the only known spider that is [[endemism|endemic]] to the Farquhar Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Saaristo 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lakshadweep''' ({{IPAc-en|l|@|k|'|sh|ah|d|w|ee|p}}, {{Audio|Lakshadweep.ogg|Lakṣadvīp}}, Lakshadīb), formerly known as the '''Laccadive, Minicoy, and Aminidivi Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|,|l|ae|k|@|d|eye|v|_|,|m|I|n|i-|k|oy|and|,|ae|m|i-|n|'|d|ee|v|i}}),&lt;ref name=il-alter-name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theindianlawyer.in/statutesnbareacts/acts/l2.html|title=The Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (Alteration Of Name Act), 1973|publisher=The Indian Lawyer|date=26 August 1973|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of islands in the [[Laccadive Sea]], {{convert|200|to|440|km|mi}} off the [[Malabar Coast|south western coast]] of [[India]]. The archipelago is a [[Union Territory]] and is governed by the [[Union Government of India]]. They were also known as '''Laccadive Islands''', although geographically this is only the name of the central subgroup of the group. ''Lakshadweep'' comes from &quot;Lakshadweepa&quot;, which means &quot;one hundred thousand islands&quot; in Sanskrit as well as many Indian languages like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakshadweep |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lakshadweep.aspx |publisher=encyclopedia.com |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100127104251/http://www.encyclopedia.com:80/topic/Lakshadweep.aspx |archivedate=27 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Lakshadweep|url=http://lakshadweeptourism.nic.in/web2.htm|publisher=lakshadweeptourism.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands form the smallest [[Union Territory]] of [[India]]: their total surface area is just {{convert|32|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The [[lagoon]] area covers about {{convert|4200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the [[territorial waters]] area {{convert|20000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the [[exclusive economic zone]] area {{convert|400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The region forms a single [[Indian district]] with ten sub divisions. [[Kavaratti]] serves as the capital of the Union Territory and the region comes under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Kerala High Court]]. The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep-Maldives-Chagos group of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X91901193 |title=Origin and compensation of Chagos-Laccadive ridge, Indian ocean, from admittance analysis of gravity and bathymetry data  |date=1991-07-31 |accessdate=2015-02-25 |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(91)90119-3 |bibcode=1991E&amp;PSL.105...47A |volume=105 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |pages=47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the islands do not have any aboriginal groups, different views have been postulated by the scholars about the history of habitation on these islands. Archaeological evidence support the existence of human settlement in the region around 1500 BC. The islands have long been known to sailors, as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century AD to the region in [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]. The islands were referenced also in the Buddhist [[Jataka tales|Jataka stories]] of the 6th century BC. The arrival of Muslim missionaries around 7th century led to the advent of Islam in the region. During the medieval period the region was ruled by the [[Chola dynasty]] and [[Kolathunadu|Kingdom of Cannanore]]. The [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived around 1498 and were upstaged by 1545. The region was then ruled by the Muslim house of [[Arakkal kingdom|Arakkal]], followed by [[Tipu Sultan]]. On his death in 1799 most of the region passed on to the [[British Raj|British]] and with their departure the Union Territory was formed in 1956.

Ten of the islands are inhabited. At the [[2011 Indian census]] the population of the Union Territory was 64,473. The majority of the indigenous population is Muslim and most of them belong to the [[Shafi'i|Shafi School]] of the Sunni Sect. The islanders are ethnically similar to the [[Malayali]] people of the nearest [[Indian state]] of [[Kerala]]. Most of the population speaks [[Malayalam]] with [[Maldivian language|Mahi (or Mahl)]] being the most spoken language in [[Minicoy]] island. The islands are served by an [[Agatti Aerodrome|airport]] on the [[Agatti]] island. The main occupation of the people is [[fishing]] and coconut cultivation, with [[tuna]] being the main item of export. These are made of coral deposit.

==History==
Several views have been postulated about the history of the habitation of the islands as they do not have any aboriginal groups. A mention of the region in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, by an anonymous author, is one of the earliest references.&lt;ref name=thefreelibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine investigations in the Lakshadweep Islands, India.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Marine+investigations+in+the+Lakshadweep+Islands,+India.-a065537229|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are references to the control of the islands by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] in the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] ''[[Patiṟṟuppattu]]''. Local traditions and legends attribute the first settlement on these islands to the period of [[Cheraman Perumal]], the last Chera king of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;“Lakshadweep &amp; It's People 1992-1993” Planning Department, Govt. Secretariat, Lakshadweep Administration, Kavaratti. Page: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest inhabited islands in the group are [[Amini, India|Amini]], [[Kalpeni]] [[Andrott]], [[Kavaratti]] and [[Agatti]]. Archaeological evidence suggests that [[Buddhism]] prevailed in the region during the 5th-6th century CE.&lt;ref name=thefreelibrary/&gt; According to popular tradition, [[Islam]] was brought to Lakshadweep by an Arab named Ubaidulla in 661 CE. His grave is located on the island of [[Andrott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/KL_History.html|publisher=lakshadweep.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 11th century, the islands came under the rule of the Late [[Cholas]]&lt;ref name=thefreelibrary/&gt; and subsequently the [[Kolathunadu|Kingdom of Cannanore]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakshadweep|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328296/Lakshadweep/46340/History|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Portuguese ruled the seas between Ormuz and the Malabar Coast -and down to Ceylon. As early as 1498 they took control of the archipelago (called Laquedivas by them), later on to exploit [[coir]] production, until the islanders expelled them in 1545. In the 17th century, the islands came under the rule of [[Ali Raja]]hs/Arakkal Bheevi of [[Kannur]], who received them as a gift from the [[Kolathiris]].  The islands are also mentioned in great detail in the stories of the Arab traveller [[Ibn Batuta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00856407908722989 |title=South Asia : Journal of South Asian Studies : Volume 2 : Sources towards a history of the Laccadive Islands |date=1979 |publisher=Tandfonline.com |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aminidivi]] group of islands (Androth, Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlath and Bitra) came under the rule of [[Tipu Sultan]] in 1787. They passed to British control after the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]] and were attached to [[South Canara]]. The rest of the islands came under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ali Raja|Arakkal family]] of [[Arakkal Kingdom|Cannanore]] in return for a payment of annual tribute. The British took over the administration of those islands for non-payment of arrears. These islands were attached to the [[Malabar district]] of the [[Madras Presidency]] during the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=William|title=Malabar Manual|year=1887|publisher=Asian Education Services|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-206-0446-6|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mR2QXrVEJIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=Palghat&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent India===
In 1956, during the [[States Reorganisation Act|reorganization of Indian states]], the Lakshadweep islands were organized into a separate union territory for administrative purposes.

To safeguard India's vital [[shipping lane]]s to the [[Middle East]], and the growing relevance of the islands in security considerations, an [[Indian Navy]] base, [[INS Dweeprakshak]], was commissioned on Kavaratti island.&lt;ref name=hindu-lakshadweep&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article3370886.ece|title=Navy commissions full-scale station in Lakshadweep|publisher=The Hindu|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[DX-pedition]] (VU7AG) by amateur radio operators was run on Agatti Island during November 2013.

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Lakshadweep-en.svg|thumb|Lakshadweep Islands map]]
[[File:LakshadweepIsland.jpg|thumb|One of the uninhabited islands in [[Bangaram Atoll]], Lakshadweep]]
[[File:Lakshadweep.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture showing the atolls of the Lakshadweep except for [[Minicoy]]]]
[[File:Lighthouse worms eye.jpg|thumb|Worms-eye view of the lighthouse in [[Minicoy]] Island]]
Lakshadweep is an [[archipelago]] of twelve [[atoll]]s, three [[reef]]s and five submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], with a total of about thirty-nine islands and islets. The reefs are in fact also atolls, although mostly submerged, with only small unvegetated sand cays above the high-water mark. The submerged banks are sunken atolls. Almost all the atolls have a northeast-southwest orientation with the islands lying on the eastern rim, and a mostly submerged reef on the western rim, enclosing a lagoon. It has 10 inhabited islands, 17 uninhabited islands, attached [[islets]], 4 newly formed islets and 5 submerged reefs.&lt;ref name=lap&gt;{{cite web|title=Location,Area and Population|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/KL_locationAreaPopulation.html|publisher=lakshadweep.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main islands are [[Kavaratti]], [[Agatti]], [[Minicoy]], and [[Amini Island|Amini]]. The total population of the territory is 60,595 according to the [[demographics of India|2001 census]]. Agatti has an [[Agatti Aerodrome|airport]] with direct flights from [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]].

===India's Coral Islands===
The '''[[Aminidivi]]''' subgroup of islands (consisting of Amini, Keltan, Chetlat, Kadamat, Bitra and Perumal Par) and the '''[[Laccadive Islands|Laccadive]]''' subgroup of islands (comprising mainly Androth, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Pitti and Suheli Par), both subgroups having a submarine connection between them through [[Pitti Bank]]. Together with '''Minicoy''' Island, a lonely atoll located at the southern end of the 200&amp;nbsp;km broad [[Nine Degree Channel]], they form the Coral Islands of India in the Arabian Sea. All these islands have been built up by [[coral]]s and have fringing [[coral reefs]] very close to their shores.&lt;ref&gt;`INDIA: A Physical Geography`(ISBN 81-230-0656-X),1968,Publications Dn, Ministry of I&amp;B, Govt. of India. page:74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two banks further north are not considered part of the group:
* [[Angria Bank]]
* [[Adas Bank]]

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Ducks on a beach at Kavaratti, Lakshadweep.jpg|thumb|Ducks on a beach at Kavaratti, Lakshadweep]]
The Lakshadweep Archipelago forms a [[terrestrial ecoregion]] together with the [[Maldives]] and the [[Chagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0125|name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has over 600 species of marine fishes, 78 species of [[coral]]s, 82 species of [[seaweed]], 52 species of [[crab]]s, 2 species of [[lobster]]s, 48 species of [[gastropod]]s, 12 species of [[bivalves]], 101 species of birds.&lt;ref name=planningreport1&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity and Environment Protection|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/documents/planning/14.pdf|work=Lakshadweep Development Report|publisher=Planning Commission of India|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the four coral reef regions in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakshadweep Development Report|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/documents/Presentation/Depts/11.pdf|publisher=Department of Environment and Forests (Union Territory of Lakshadweep)|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corals are a major attraction for the tourist. [[Pitti]] Island, is an important breeding place for [[sea turtles]] and for a number of [[pelagic bird]]s such as the [[brown noddy]] (''Anous stolidus''), [[lesser crested tern]] (''Sterna bengalensis)'' and [[greater crested tern]] (''Sterna bergii'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orientalbirdclub.org/publications/forktail/10pdfs/Kurup-Lakshadweep.pdf] {{wayback|url=http://www.orientalbirdclub.org/publications/forktail/10pdfs/Kurup-Lakshadweep.pdf |date=20120112215302 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island has been declared a bird sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/depts/forest/wildlife_(protection)act.htm|publisher=Department of Environment and Forests (Union Territory of Lakshadweep)|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region does not have a rich flora and almost all the plants can be found on the mainland of India. There is also an absence of forest in the region. Nearly 400 species of flowering plants have been documented, including three species of sea grasses ''[[Cymodocia isoetifolia]]'', ''[[Syringodium isoetifolium]]'' and ''[[Thalassia hemprichii]]'', other [[angiosperms]] as ''[[Pandanus]]'', ''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]'', ''[[Tournefortia argentea]]'' and ''[[Pemphis acidula]]'' as well as [[fungi]], [[algae]], [[lichen]]s are also found. The common flora of the coral sands include coconut groves and coastal shrubs as ''[[Pemphis acidula]]'', ''[[Cordia subcordata]]'', ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'', ''[[Thespesia populnea]]'', ''[[Suriana maritima]]'', ''[[Dodonaea viscosa]]'', ''[[Guettarda speciosa]]'' and [[seaweeds]] such as [[sea lettuce]]s, ''[[Codium]]'' and ''[[Hypena]]''.&lt;ref name=planningreport1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rao, T.A. &amp; J.L.

The inhabitants of Lakshadweep are known to practice different religious customs that were once propounded by the [[Sheikh Ubaidullah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/ISLAND_web/KILTAN/history.html |title=Kiltan Island |publisher=Lakshadweep.nic.in |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is believed to be the propagator of Islam religion in Lakshadweep.

There are several festivals that have originated in the island of Lakshadweep to mark the eminence of Islam. Eid-Ul-Fitr, Muharram, Bakra Eid and Milad-Un-Nabi are the prominent occasions when the people of the island gather in various mosques to commemorate the holy sermons of the various prophets.

Religion of Lakshadweep is characterized by certain unusual festivals too that are found in the core ethnic groups of the place. Moulood is one such religious event when the islanders offer prayers to the divine power and eat in groups. The festival of Ratheeb is another uncommon occasion which originated in the Kavaratti region of Lakshadweep. The grave of Sheikh Kasim, one of the respected saints of Islam is praised during Ratheeb by the people of the island to gather his holy blessings.

The Sunni branch of Islam is the predominant faith.

The principal languages of Lakshadweep are [[Malayalam]], [[Jeseri language|Jeseri]] (Dweep Bhasha) and [[Maldivian language|Mahl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_lakshadweep.php] {{wayback|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_lakshadweep.php |date=20110205082119 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of all the northern islands speak a [[dialect]] of Malayalam with [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Arabic]] similar to [[Arwi]] influenced by extensive trade activities of these people. The people of [[Minicoy]], the southernmost atoll, speak Mahl, a variant of [[Divehi language]] spoken in the [[Maldives]].

Malayalam with [[Malayalam script]] was introduced as the official language of Lakshadweep during the [[British raj]]. Previously a type of [[Arabic script]] ([[Arabi Malayalam]]) was used for the language. The policy was continued by the Indian government. Malayalam serves as a link language on the islands including on the Mahl dominated Minicoy Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_a4G_Tw2ycC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Lakshadweep+malayalam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KuV4TeqwIszHsgb53oTlBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lakshadweep%20malayalam&amp;f=false |title=The Muslim Tribes of Lakshadweep Islands: An Anthropological Appraisal of ... - Makhan Jha - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:A beach side resort at Kadmat Island, Lakshadweep.jpg|220px|thumb|A beach side resort at Kadmat Island, Lakshadweep]]
Lakshadweep's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at [[US$]] 60&amp;nbsp;million at current prices. There is little [[economic inequality]] in Lakshadweep and the [[poverty]] index is low. [[Coconut fibre]] extraction and production of fibre products is Lakshadweep's main industry. There are five coir fibre factories, five production demonstration centres and seven fibre curling units run by the government of India. These units produce coir fibre, coir yarn, curled fibre and corridor mattings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/84466.pdf |format=PDF |title=Report of the Working Group on Improvement of Banking Services in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep |publisher=Rbidocs.rbi.org.in |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisheries===

Lakshadweep comprises the only coral [[atolls]] of the country. With a vast [[lagoon]] of 4,200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it has [[territorial waters]] of 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 4,00,000 Lakhs km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [[coast|coastal line]] of about 132&amp;nbsp;km. There is an estimation of about one [[lakh]] tonnes of [[tuna]] and tuna like fishes and about an equal quantity of [[shark]] in the [[Laccadive Sea|sea around Lakshadweep]]. Fishing is the main livelihood of the islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FISHERIES|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/AnnualPlan_2011_2012_7.htm|publisher=http://lakshadweep.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshly caught tuna is processed by drying it in the sun after cooking and smoking. The resultant product, known as `mas`, are popular products exported from these islands to [[Southeast Asia|southeast Asian countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Fisheries-About Us|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/depts/fisheries/About%20Us.htm|publisher=lakshadweep.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven workshops in islands and two boat building yards cater to the needs of fishermen. There are 375 boats in operation in Lakshadweep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries|url=http://lakshadweep.nic.in/KL_Fisheries.html|publisher=lakshadweep.nic.in|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Agatti island, Lakshadweep.jpg|thumb|Agatti island, Lakshadweep]]
Due to its isolation and scenic appeal, Lakshadweep was already known as a tourist attraction for Indians since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakshadweeptourism.nic.in/ |title=Tourism in Lakshadweep |publisher=Lakshadweeptourism.nic.in |date=1988-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brings in significant revenue, which is likely to increase. Since such a small region cannot support industries, the government is actively promoting tourism as a means of income in [[Bangaram Island|Bangaram]] and Kadmat islands. Bangaram is projected as a major destination for international tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/lakshadweep/tourism/bangaram-island.html] {{wayback|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/lakshadweep/tourism/bangaram-island.html |date=20110510124248 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marine fauna are plentiful. Water sports activities such as [[scuba diving]], [[wind surfing]], [[snorkelling]], [[surfing]], [[kayaking]], [[canoeing]], [[water skiing]], [[sportfishing]], yachting and night-voyages into the sea are quite popular activities among tourists. Tourists flock to these islands throughout the year except during the [[South-west monsoon]] months when seas are extremely rough. Government has also proposed to set up two customs clearance check-in offices so that tourists can directly enter these islands instead of getting permission from nearest customs office in Kochi, which is 260 nautical miles from these islands. These will be the smallest customs offices in India. Tourism is expected to get big boost after this as these islands lie on one of the busiest cruise way.

A [[low-temperature thermal desalination]] plant opened on Kavaratti in 2005, at a cost of {{INR}}50&amp;nbsp;million (€922,000). The experimental plant, which uses the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and much colder seawater at 500m depth to generate potable water as well as energy, was slated to produce 100,000&amp;nbsp;litres/day of potable water from seawater.&lt;ref name=plantpress&gt;{{cite press release|title=World’s first ever low temperature thermal desalination plant opened at Kavaratti|publisher=[[Ministry of Science and Technology (India)]]|date=23 May 2005|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=9439|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=One Million Litre Per Day (1 MLD) Barge Mounted Desalination Plant|publisher=[[Ministry of Science and Technology (India)]]|date=18 April 2007|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=26958|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production costs in 2005 were {{INR}}220-250/m³ (€4.1-4.6/m³); the cost was supposed to drop to {{INR}}30-60/m³ (€0.55-1.11/m³) with increased capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Desalination: India opens world’s first low temperature thermal desalination plant |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India |date=23 May 2005 |url=http://www.source.irc.nl/page/24010 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120722034730/http://www.source.irc.nl/page/24010 |archivedate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was developed by the [[National Institute of Ocean Technology]]. It can be used to produce drinking water and also for power generation and air conditioning. In addition, the deep seawater contains extra nutrients for fish, an important source of food and income for the local population. The government plans to set up desalination plants with a capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;million litres/per day on all islands and coastal areas.&lt;ref name=plantpress/&gt; In 2009, the NIOT announced plans to build plants on [[Maliku Atoll|Minicoy]], [[Agatti Island|Agatti]] and [[Andrott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/11/19/stories/2009111961820300.htm|title=City institute plans to develop manned submersibles|date=19 November 2009|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It lies southwest of [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The chain of [[Atolls of the Maldives|twenty six atolls]] stretches from [[Atolls of the Maldives|Ihavandhippolhu Atoll]] to the [[Atolls of the Maldives|Addu Atoll]]. The capital is [[Malé]], traditionally called the &quot;[[List of sultans of the Maldives|King's Island]]&quot;. 

Historically linked with the [[Indian subcontinent]], Maldives is a [[Muslim]]-majority country. From the mid-sixteenth century [[colonialism|colonial powers]] dominated the islands: [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]] and Britain. The islands gained [[Second Republic of the Maldives|independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, becoming a republic in 1968. The country is ruled by a [[President of Maldives|president]] and its government is [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. The [[economy of Maldives|Maldivian economy]] is dominated by [[Tourism in the Maldives|tourism]] and [[Fishing in the Maldives|fishing]]. The World Bank classifies the country as having an upper [[middle income]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/income-level/UMC Upper middle income] [[World Bank]]. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encompassing a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] spread over roughly {{convert|90000|km2}}, Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed countries. It is the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|smallest Asian country]] in both land area and in population. The archipelago is located atop the [[Chagos-Maldives-Laccadive Ridge]], a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean, which also forms a [[terrestrial ecoregion]], together with the Chagos and the Lakshadweep.&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion |id=im0125 |name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average ground-level elevation of {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/11/climatechange-endangered-habitats-maldives |work= The Guardian |location= London |title= The last days of paradise |first= Jon |last= Henley |date= 11 November 2008 |accessdate= 12 May 2010 | quote= [The Maldives] holds the record for the country with the lowest high point on earth: nowhere on the Maldives does the natural ground level exceed 2.3m.

It is also the country with the [[List of countries by highest point|lowest natural highest point]] in the world, at {{convert|2.4|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The government has pledged to make Maldives a [[carbon neutral|carbon-neutral]] country by 2019 amid concerns about [[Current sea level rise|rising sea-levels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;copenhagen_accord&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/earth/20091218_CLIMATE_TEXT.pdf |title= Copenhagen Accord|publisher= New York Times|date= 18 December 2009|accessdate= 2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldives became a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and it hosted the [[17th SAARC summit]] in 2011.  It is also a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The name ''Maldives'' may derive from the [[Malayalam]] words &quot;maala&quot; (garland) and &quot;dweepu&quot; (island) or the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''maalai'' (garland / evening) and ''theevu'' (island),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogendorn&quot; /&gt; or &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;si&quot;&gt;මාල දිවයින&lt;/span&gt; ''Maala Divaina'' (&quot;Necklace Islands&quot;) in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ParanavitanaPrematilleka1978&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1= P.

The word ''Theevu'' (archaic ''Dheevu'', related to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;ta&quot;&gt;தீவு&lt;/span&gt; ''dheevu'') means &quot;island&quot;, and ''Dhives'' (''Dhivehin'') means &quot;islanders&quot; (i.e., Maldivians).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The ancient [[Sri Lanka]]n chronicle ''[[Mahawamsa]]'' refers to an island called ''Mahiladiva'' (&quot;Island of Women&quot;, महिलादिभ) in [[Pali]], which is probably a mistranslation of the same Sanskrit word meaning &quot;[[garland]]&quot;.

Jan S Hogendorn, Grossman Professor of Economics, theorises that the name ''Maldives'' derives from the Sanskrit ''mālādvīpa'' (&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;sa&quot;&gt;मालाद्वीप&lt;/span&gt;), meaning &quot;garland of islands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogendorn&quot;&gt;Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986). ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]] ISBN 0521541107, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; In Tamil, &quot;Garland of Islands&quot; can be translated as ''MalaiTheevu'' (&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;ta&quot;&gt;மாலைத்தீவு&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org/MV/other-names-for-maldives.html |title=Altername Names for Republic of Maldives |publisher=Geonames.org |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malayalam, &quot;Garland of Islands&quot; can be translated as ''Maladweepu'' (&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;ml&quot;&gt;മാലദ്വീപ്&lt;/span&gt;). In Kannada, &quot;Garland of Islands&quot; can be translated as ''Maaledweepa'' (&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;ಮಾಲೆದ್ವೀಪ&lt;/span&gt;). None of these names is mentioned in any literature, but classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the [[Vedic period]] mention the &quot;Hundred Thousand Islands&quot; (''[[Lakshadweepa]]''), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the [[Laccadives]], [[Aminidivi]] Islands, [[Minicoy]] and the [[Chagos Archipelago|Chagos island]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;Apte, Vaman Shivram (1985). ''Sanskrit-English Dictionary''. Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval travellers such as [[Ibn Batuta]] called the islands ''Mahal Dibiyat'' (&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot; lang=&quot;ar&quot;&gt;محل دبيأت&lt;/span&gt;) from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Mahal'' (&quot;palace&quot;), which must be how the [[Berber people|Berber]] traveller interpreted the local name, having been through Muslim North India, where [[Perso-Arabic]] words were introduced to the local vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Batuta ''Travels in Asia and Africa''. translated by A. R. Gibb.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive state emblem]]. The classical Persian/Arabic name for Maldives is ''Dibajat''.&lt;ref&gt;Akhbar al-Sin wa 'l-Hind (Notes on China and India), which dates from 851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm |title=The Seas of Sinbad|volume=56|issue= 4 |year=2005 |journal=Saudi Aramco World}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch referred to the islands as the &quot;Maldivische Eilanden&quot; ({{IPA-nl|mɑlˈdivisə ˈɛi̯lɑndə(n)|pron}}), while the British [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] the local name for the islands first to the &quot;Maldive Islands&quot; and later to &quot;Maldives.&quot;

==History==
{{main|History of the Maldives}}

===Ancient history and settlement===
Comparative studies of Maldivian oral, linguistic and cultural traditions and customs indicate that early settlers were [[Dravidian people]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''. Barcelona 1999, ISBN 84-7254-801-5.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Tamil Nadu]] in the [[Sangam period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC–AD 300), most probably fishermen from the [[Malabar coast|southwest coasts]] of what is now the south of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the western shores of [[Sri Lanka]]. One such community is the [[Giraavaru people]] descended from ancient [[Tamil people|Tamils]]. They are mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in [[Malé]].

A strong underlying layer of Dravidian population and culture survives in Maldivian society, with a clear Dravidian-Malayalam substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs. Malabari seafaring culture led to [[Malayali]] settling of the [[Laccadives]], and the Maldives were evidently viewed as an extension of that archipelago. Some argue (from the presence of Jat, Gujjar Titles and Gotra names) that [[Sindhis]] also accounted for an early layer of migration. Seafaring from [[Debal]] began during the [[Indus valley civilisation]]. The [[Jataka]]s and [[Puranas]] show abundant evidence of this maritime trade; the use of similar traditional boat building techniques in Northwestern South Asia and the Maldives, and the presence of silver punch mark coins from both regions, gives additional weight to this. There are minor signs of Southeast Asian settlers, probably some adrift from the main group of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] reed boat migrants that settled [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maloney, Clarence&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives People |author=Maloney, Clarence |url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|work=International Institute for Asian Studies |accessdate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written history of the Maldives is marked by the arrival of [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] people, who were descended from the exiled [[Magadha]] Prince [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] from the ancient city known as [[Sinhapura]]. He and his party of several hundred landed in Sri Lanka, and some in the Maldives circa 543 to 483&amp;nbsp;BC. According to the ''[[Mahavansa]]'', one of the ships that sailed with Prince Vijaya, who went to Sri Lanka around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, went adrift and arrived at an island called ''Mahiladvipika'', which is being identified with the Maldives. It is also said that at that time, the people from Mahiladvipika used to travel to Sri Lanka. Their settlement in Sri Lanka and the Maldives marks a significant change in demographics and the development of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], which is most similar in grammar, phonology, and structure to [[Sinhala Language|Sinhala]], and especially to the more ancient [[Elu Prakrit]], which has less [[Pali]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Alternatively, it is believed that ''Vijaya'' and his clan came from western India – a claim supported by linguistic and cultural features, and specific descriptions in the epics themselves, e.g. that ''Vijaya'' visited ''Bharukaccha'' ([[Bharuch]] in Gujarat) in his ship on the voyage down south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maloney, Clarence&quot;/&gt;

[[Philostorgius]], a Greek historian of Late Antiquity, wrote of a hostage among the Romans, from the island called ''Diva'', which is presumed to be the Maldives, who was baptised Theophilus. Theophilus was sent in the 350s to convert the [[Himyarites]] to Christianity, and went to his homeland from [[Arabia]]; he returned to Arabia, visited [[Axum]], and settled in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;Philostorgius, ''Church History'', tr. Amidon, pp.41–44; Philostorgius' history survives in fragments, and he wrote some 75 years later than these events.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist period===
[[File:gan L03s1.jpg|thumb|The Buddhist Stupa (the best preserved, the largest and the last of the Buddhist temples that were destroyed) at ''Kuruhinna'' in [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan Island (Haddhunmathi Atoll)]].]]
Buddhism came to the Maldives at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion, and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th&amp;nbsp;century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, are from that period. Before embracing Buddhism as their way of life, Maldivians had practised an ancient form of [[Hinduism]], [[ritual]]istic traditions known as ''Śrauta'', in the form of venerating the ''[[Surya]]'' (the ancient ruling caste were of ''Aadheetta'' or ''Suryavanshi'' origins).

The first archaeological study of the remains of early cultures in the Maldives began with the work of [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell|H.C.P. Bell]], a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commissioner of the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. Bell was first ordered to the islands in late 1879&lt;ref&gt;This was in order to care for a shipwrecked British steamer's load. Bell moreover had the chance to spend two or three in Malé, on same occasion. See: Bethia Nancy Bell, Heather M. Bell: ''H.C.P. Bell: Archaeologist of Ceylon and the Maldives,'' [https://books.google.at/books?id=BjlmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Harry+Charles+Purvis+Bell+M%C3%A1ldives+%22Sea-Gull%22&amp;dq=Harry+Charles+Purvis+Bell+M%C3%A1ldives+%22Sea-Gull%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1OFMU-SJCe2f7gbO1IBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ p.16.]&lt;/ref&gt; he returned twice to the Maldives to investigate ancient ruins. He studied the ancient mounds, called ''havitta'' or ''ustubu'' (these names are derived from [[stupa|chaitiya]] and [[stupa]]) ({{lang-dv| ހަވިއްތަ}}) by the Maldivians, which are found on many of the atolls. Although Bell asserted that the ancient Maldivians had followed [[Theravada Buddhism]], many local Buddhist archaeological remains now in the [[Malé]] Museum in fact also display elements of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] iconography.

[[File:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Isdhoo (Laamu Atoll)|Isdhoo]] Lōmāfānu is the oldest [[Lōmāfānu|copper-plate]] book to have been discovered in the Maldives to date. The book was written in AD&amp;nbsp;1194 (590&amp;nbsp;AH) in the Evēla form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].
]]

In the early 11th century, the [[Minicoy Island|Minicoy]] and Thiladhunmathi, and possibly other northern Atolls, were conquered by the [[Medieval Cholas|medieval Chola]] Tamil emperor [[Raja Raja Chola I]], thus becoming a part of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola Empire]].

According to a legend from [[Maldivian folklore]], in the early 12th&amp;nbsp;century AD, a medieval prince named [[Koimala of the Maldives|Koimala]], a nobleman of the Lion Race from Sri Lanka, sailed to Rasgetheemu island (literally &quot;Town of the Royal House&quot;, or figuratively &quot;King's Town&quot;) in the North Maalhosmadulu Atoll, and from there to Malé, and established a kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} By then, the ''Aadeetta'' (Sun) Dynasty (the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] ruling cast) had for some time ceased to rule in Malé, possibly because of invasions by the Cholas of Southern India in the 10th century. Koimala Kalou (Lord Koimala), who reigned as King Maanaabarana, was a king of the ''Homa'' (Lunar) Dynasty (the [[Chandravanshi]] ruling cast), which some historians call the [[House of Theemuge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maldives Royal Family&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lion Throne Coronation Proclamation of King Siri Kula Sudha Ira Siyaaka Saathura Audha Keerithi Katthiri Bovana|date=21 July 1938|work=Maldives Royal Family |url=http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/maldives_proclamation_sultan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Homa'' (Lunar) dynasty sovereigns intermarried with the ''Aaditta'' (Sun) Dynasty. This is why the formal titles of Maldive kings until 1968 contained references to &quot;''kula sudha ira''&quot;, which means &quot;descended from the Moon and the Sun&quot;. No official record exists of the Aadeetta dynasty's reign. Since Koimala's reign, the Maldive throne was also known as the ''Singaasana'' (Lion Throne).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maldives Royal Family&quot;/&gt; Before then, and in some situations since, it was also known as the ''Saridhaaleys'' (Ivory Throne).&lt;ref name=&quot;koimala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Legend of Koimala Kalou|work=Maldives Royal Family |url=http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/maldives_koimala.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians credit Koimala with freeing the Maldives from [[Chola empire|Chola]] rule.

Several foreign travellers, mainly Arabs, had written about a kingdom of the Maldives ruled over by a queen. This kingdom pre-dated Koimala's reign. [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]], referring to earlier writers, mentions the name of one of the queens, Damahaar, who was a member of the ''Aadeetta'' (Sun) dynasty.

===Islamic Period===
[[File:Yousuftabrizi.jpg|thumb|A Plaque in Juma Mosque, Malé, Maldives, on which [[Yusuf Tabrizi]]'s name is written. Yusuf Tabrizi was a Persian who is said to have converted Maldives in 12th century AD to [[Islam]].]]

The conversion to Islam is mentioned in the edicts written in copper plates from the end of the 12th&amp;nbsp;century AD.

The famous Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Batutta]], who visited the Maldives in the 14th century, wrote how a Moroccan, one ''Abu Barakat the Berber'', was believed to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the islands. Even though this report has been contested in later sources, it does explain some crucial aspects of Maldivian culture. For instance, historically Arabic has been the prime language of administration there, instead of the Persian and Urdu languages used in the nearby Muslim states. Another link to North Africa was the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence, used throughout most of North Africa, which was the official one in the Maldives until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC The Adventures of Ibn Battuta: A Muslim Traveller of the Fourteenth Century]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and have posited another scenario where this Abu Barakat might have been a native of [[Berbera]], a significant trading port on the north western coast of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_G5Qpc2dBI |title=Richard Bulliet – History of the World to 1500 CE (Session 22) – Tropical Africa and Asia |publisher=Youtube.com |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario would also help explain the usage of the Arabic language and the predominance of the Maliki school on the islands.

Another interpretation, held by some of the islanders, is that Abu Barakat was an Iranian from Tabriz. In the Arabic script the words al-Barbari and al-Tabrizi are very much alike, owing to the fact that at the time, Arabic had several consonants that looked identical and could only be differentiated by overall context (this has since changed by addition of dots above or below letters to clarify pronunciation – For example, the letter &quot;B&quot; in modern Arabic has a dot below, whereas the letter &quot;T&quot; looks identical except there are two dots above it).  The first reference to an Iranian origin dates to an 18th-century Persian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul, Ludwig |title=Persian Origins--: Early Judaeo-Persian and the Emergence of New Persian : Collected Papers of the Symposium, Göttingen 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuKN47W68SkC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04731-9|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldives was the first landfall for traders from [[Basrah]], sailing to [[Sri Lanka]] or Southeast Asia. In the Maldives, ships could take on fresh water, fruit and the delicious, basket-smoked red flesh of the black ''[[bonito]]'', a delicacy exported to [[Sindh]], China and [[Yemen]]. The people of the archipelago were described as gentle, civilised and hospitable. They produced [[brass]] utensils as well as fine cotton textiles, exported in the form of sarongs and turban lengths. These local industries must have depended on imported raw materials.

The other essential product of the Maldives was ''[[coir]]'', the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]]. Cured in pits, beaten, spun and then twisted into [[cordage]] and [[rope]]s, coir's salient quality is its resistance to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

&quot;It is stronger than [[hemp]]&quot;, wrote [[Ibn Battuta]], &quot;and is used to sew together the planks of Sindhi and Yemeni dhows, for this sea abounds in reefs, and if the planks were fastened with iron nails, they would break into pieces when the vessel hit a rock. The coir gives the boat greater elasticity, so that it doesn't break up.&quot;

===British protectorate, 1887–1965===
[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]
On 16 December 1887, the Sultan of the Maldives signed a contract with the British [[Governor of Ceylon]] turning the Maldives into a [[British protectorate|British protected state]], thus giving up the islands' [[sovereignty]] in matters of [[foreign policy]], but retaining internal self-government. The British government promised military protection and non-interference in local administration in exchange for an annual [[tribute]], so that the islands were akin to an Indian [[princely state]].

In 1953, there was an abortive attempt to form a republic, but the sultanate survived. In 1957 the British established an air base in the strategic southernmost atoll of Addu, paying £2000 a year, employing hundreds of locals. Nineteen years later, the British government (Labour's Harold Wilson) gave up the base, as it was too expensive to maintain.&lt;ref name=&quot;gan.philliptsmall.me.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, objecting to [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s centralism, the inhabitants of the three southernmost atolls protested against the government. They formed the [[United Suvadive Republic]] and elected [[Abdullah Afeef]] as president and chose [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital of this republic.

===Independence and Republic===
[[File:Mohamed Amin.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Mohamed Amin Didi]] served as the first president of the Maldives for most of 1953 and was deposed for his unpopular policies.]]
During the 1950s and 1960s, the British presence east of [[Suez]] was in steep decline. On 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of His Majesty the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Colombo. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King rather than Sultan.

On 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, forty voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

[[File:Maumoon-Abdul-Gayoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamoon Abdul Gayoom]], [[President of the Maldives]] (1978–2008).]] 
[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was Kurumba Maldives which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 persons residing in Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives – Population&quot;. Library of Congress Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;
Political infighting during the '70s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export. With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to [[Singapore]] in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.

[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as President in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Gayoom's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Gayoom's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Gayoom was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_sinking&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80-person mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE Tamil militant group]] who seized the airport and caused Gayoom to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Malé]] restored order.

A November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman. On the night of 3 November 1988, the [[Indian Air Force]] airlifted a parachute battalion group from [[Agra]] and flew them over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} to the Maldives. The Indian [[paratroopers]] landed at [[Hulule]] and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at Malé within hours. The brief, bloodless operation, labelled ''[[Operation Cactus]]'', also involved the [[Indian Navy]]. &lt;!-- the rest of this, about the tsunami and 2008 elections, needs to get updated in the History of the Maldives article --&gt;

During the later part of Gayoom's rule, independent political movements emerged in Maldives, which challenged the then-ruling [[Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party]] (Maldivian People's Party) and demanded democratic reform.

The dissident journalist Mohamed Nasheed rose to challenge the autocratic rule of Gayoom. Nasheed was imprisoned a total of 16 times under Gayoom’s rule. Persisting in his activism, he founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003 while in exile. His activism, as well as civil unrest that year, pressured Gayoom into allowing for gradual political reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpoliticalreview.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/04/autocracy-and-back-again-the-ordeal-of-the-maldives/ Autocracy and Back Again: The Ordeal of the Maldives]. Brown Political Review. Retrieved on 10 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

These movements brought about significant change in political structure. In 2008 a new constitution was approved and the first direct presidential elections occurred, which were won by [[Mohamed Nasheed]] and [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] (as Vice-President) in the second round. The 2009 parliamentary election saw the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] of President Nasheed receive the most votes with 30.81%, gaining 26 seats, although the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party, with 24.62% of the vote, received the most seats (28).

The government of President Mohamed Nasheed faced many challenges, including the huge debts left by the previous government, the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami, overspending (by means of overprinting of local currency rufiyaa) during his regime, unemployment, corruption, and increasing drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=he Quality of Political Appointees in the Nasheed Administration |author=Raajje News |url=http://raajjenews.blogspot.com/2009/06/quality-of-political-appointees-in.html |accessdate=21 February 2012 |date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Mohamed Nasheed cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The ousted democratically elected president [[Mohamed Nasheed]].]]
Taxation on goods was imposed for the first time in the country, and import duties were reduced in many goods and services. Social welfare benefits were given to those above 65 years of age, single parents, and those with special needs. On 10 November 2008, Nasheed announced an intent to create a [[sovereign wealth fund]] with money earned from tourism that could be used to purchase land elsewhere for the Maldives people to relocate should rising sea levels due to [[climate change]] inundate the country. The government reportedly considered locations in Sri Lanka and India due to cultural and climate similarities, and as far away as Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_sinking&quot;/&gt;

On 23 December 2011, the opposition held a mass symposium with as many as 20,000 people in the name of protecting Islam, which they believed Nasheed's government was unable to maintain in the country. The mass event became the foundation of a campaign that brought about social unrest within the capital city.

President Mohamed Nasheed resigned on 7 February 2012 by letter, and followed that with a televised public address informing Maldivians of his resignation. Later Nasheed told foreign media that he was deposed by a military coup led by President Waheed. There have been disputes over exactly what happened that day.

Many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, were quick to abandon Nasheed, instead endorsing his successor. (The United States backtracked in late 2012 in response to widespread criticism.)&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpoliticalreview.org&quot;/&gt; On 23 February 2012, the Commonwealth suspended the Maldives from its democracy and human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]] while the ousting was being investigated, and backed Nasheed's call for elections before the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths |first=Peter |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/02/22/maldives-commonwealth-idINDEE81L0JO20120222 |title=Commonwealth suspends Maldives from rights group, seeks elections |publisher=In.reuters.com |date= 22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October, Nasheed was arrested after failing to appear in court to face charges that he ordered the illegal arrest of a judge while in office. However, his supporters claim that this detention was politically motivated in order to prevent him from campaigning for the 2013 presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed Nasheed, Former Maldives President, Arrested After Failing To Appear In Court|editor=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/08/mohamed-nasheed-maldives-former-president-arrested_n_1947348.html |accessdate=18 September 2015 |date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 the former president Nasheed was convicted under the country's terrorism laws for ordering the arrest of an allegedly corrupt judge in 2012 and jailed for 13 years.

Recently (Oct. 2015) Nasheed has appealed to Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], suggesting Modi has the ability to “disentangle” the Maldives from the “mess we are in”. Maldives’ international partners including the EU, US, UK and the United Nations had said his rushed trial was seriously flawed following a UN panel ruling in the former president’s favour. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for his immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/63227] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Nasheed was jailed, President Mohammed Waheed Hassan announced a presidential election would be held in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307231418/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/18/maldives-election_n_1433449.html Maldives Election: President Mohammed Waheed Hassan Calls For Early Vote In 2013]. ''Huffington Post'' (18 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections in late 2013 were highly contested. Former president Mohammed Nasheed won the most votes in the first round. Contrary to the assessment of international election observers, the Supreme Court cited irregularities and annulled it. In the end, the opposition combined to gain a majority. Abdulla Yameen, half-brother of the former dictator Gayoom, assumed the presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpoliticalreview.org&quot;/&gt;

Yameen implemented a foreign policy shift towards increased engagement with China, establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Yameen employed Islam as a tool of identity politics, framing religious mobilization as the solution to perceived Western attempts to undermine Maldivian national sovereignty. Yameen’s policy of connecting Islam with anti-Western rhetoric represented a new development.&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpoliticalreview.org&quot;/&gt;

On 28 September 2015 there was an assassination attempt on President Abdulla Yameen as he was returning from Saudi Arabia after the haj pilgrimage. As his speedboat was docking at Male there was an explosion on board. Amid screams, the right door of the boat fell on the jetty and there was heavy smoke. Three people were injured, including his wife, but the President managed to escape unhurt.

In a probe of the explosion targeting president, on 24 October 2015 Maldives vice president Ahmed Adheeb was arrested at the airport upon his return from a conference in China. 17 of Adheeb's supporters were also arrested for &quot;public order offences&quot;. The government instituted a broader crackdown against political dissent. Though the popular image of the Maldives is that of a holiday paradise, its radicalised youths are enlisting in significant numbers to fight for Islamic State militants in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Bosley, Daniel.

On 4 November 2015, President Abdulla Yameen declared a 30-day [[state of emergency]] ahead of a planned anti-government rally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34718916 Maldives declares 30-day emergency – BBC News]. Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 10 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2015 (the next day), as per the ''State of Emergency'' bill made by the  President, the [[people's Majlis]] decided to rush the process for the removal of Vice president [[Ahmed Adeeb]] by a [[no confidence vote]] that was submitted by PPM Parliament than the originally intended period. As a result, the Majlis passed the ''no confidence vote'' with a majority of 61 members favouring it, removing Adeeb from the post of Vice President in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;majlis.gov.mv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Majlis passes declaration to remove VP from office|url=http://www.majlis.gov.mv/en/2015/11/05/majlis-passes-declaration-to-remove-ahmed-adeeb-abdul-gafoor-from-the-post-of-vice-president|accessdate=5 November 2015|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the Maldives}}

[[File:Malosmadulu Atolls, Maldives.jpg|thumb|upright|Malhosmadulhu Atoll seen from space. &quot;Fasdutere&quot; and [[Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll]] can be seen in this picture.]]
The Maldives consists of 1,192 [[coral island]]s grouped in a double chain of 26 [[atoll]]s, along the north-south direction, spread over roughly {{convert|90000|km²}}, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries. It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1°S]] and [[8th parallel north|8°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72°]] and [[74th meridian east|74°E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.

Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes the Maldivian government organised these atolls into twenty one [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]]. The largest island of Maldives is [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In [[Addu Atoll]] the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called [[Seenu Atoll#Addu Link Road|Link Road]]) and the total length of the road is {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only {{convert|2.4|m}} and {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/06/201062915490741700.html |title=Entire Maldives cabinet resigns |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]].

===Protected areas of Maldives===

Protected areas of Maldives are administrated by [[Ministry of Environment and Energy]] and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Maldives. There are [[List of Protected Areas of Maldives|31 protected areas]] in Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maldives Protected Areas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov.mv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=25&amp;limitstart=1|title=Protected Areas – Maldives|work=epa.gov.mv|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===

[[File:Sunset in the Maldives.jpg|thumb|Sunset in the Maldives]]
The Maldives has a tropical-monsoon climate, which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season which brings strong winds and storms.

The shift from the moist southwest monsoon to the dry northeast monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the northeast winds contribute to the formation of the northeast monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of August. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives – Atlapedia Online|url=http://www.atlapedia.com/online/countries/maldives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former [[President of the Maldives|Maldivian president]] [[Mohamed Nasheed]], the Maldives are ranked the third most endangered nation due to flooding from [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Marcus | last = Stephen | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+sinking+feeling%3A+why+is+the+president+of+the+tiny+Pacific+island...-a0273079165 | title = A sinking feeling: Why is the president of the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru so concerned about climate change?| work = [[The New York Times Upfront]] |accessdate = 9 February 2015 | authorlink = Marcus Stephen | date = 14 November 2011 | quote = Most Endangered Island nations at highest risk for flooding due to climate change 3 Maldives (Indian Ocean) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March and April 2012, Nasheed stated, &quot;If carbon emissions were to stop today, the planet would not see a difference for 60 to 70 years.&quot; &quot;If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be under water in seven years.&quot; He called for more [[climate change mitigation]] action while on the American television shows ''[[The Daily Show]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-2-2012/exclusive---mohamed-nasheed-extended-interview-pt--2 |title=Exclusive – Mohamed Nasheed Extended Interview Pt. 2 |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Nation |url=http://www.guilfordian.com/worldnation/2012/04/06/endangered-island-nations-call-for-global-action-on-climate-change/ |title=Endangered island nations call for global action on climate change |publisher=Guilfordian.com |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s 2007 report predicted the upper limit of the sea level rises will be {{convert|59|cm}} by 2100, which means that most of the republic's 200 inhabited islands may need to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/editorial/where-climate-change-threatens-survival-20120108-1pq4c.html |accessdate=18 September 2015 |title=Where climate change threatens survival |date=9 January 2012 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study appears to show that the sea level in the Maldives dropped {{convert|20|-|30|cm|0}} throughout the 1970s and '80s, although later studies failed to back this up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mörner N.-A., Tooley M. and Possnert, G|accessdate=18 September 2015|title=New Perspectives for the future of the Maldives|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/MornerEtAl2004.pdf|date=7 May 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed rate of sea level rise is only 1.7–1.8 millimeters per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/globalregional.htm Sea Level Trends – Global Regional Trends].

In November 2008, President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia because of his concerns about global warming, and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels. The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Paradise almost lost: Maldives seek to buy a new homeland| first=Randeep| last= Ramesh| date=10 November 2008|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President has explained his intentions: &quot;We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be [[climate refugee]]s living in tents for decades&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ramesh, Randeep |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change |title=Paradise almost lost: Maldives seek to buy a new homeland|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 November 2008|accessdate=30 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2008, then President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] pleaded for a cut in global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, warning that rising sea levels could submerge the island nation of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;(AFP) – 22 April, &quot;awareness of threats from climate change to low-lying nations such as the Maldives.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maldives leader in climate change stunt |author=Lang, Olivia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8312320.stm |accessdate=19 October 2010|work=BBC News|date=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2020, Maldives plans to eliminate or offset all of its greenhouse gas emissions. At the 2009 International Climate Talks, President Mohamed Nasheed explained that: &lt;blockquote&gt;For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, it is in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalize on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate Change Gridlock: Where Do We Go From Here?

Other environmental issues include bad waste disposal and [[beach theft]]. Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little litter can be found on the islands, no good waste disposal sites exist. Most trash from Male and other resorts is simply dumped at [[Thilafushi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hall, Chris |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2162653/Maldives-island-paradise-Thilafushi-trashed-reduced-pile-rubbish.html |title=Paradise trashed: The beautiful island in the Maldives that's been reduced to a pile of rubbish |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2015 |date= 23 June 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine ecosystem===

{{further|Wildlife of Maldives}}
[[File:Maldives Oriental sweetlips, Plectorhinchus vittatus.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental Sweetlips]] (''Plectorhinchus vittatus'') at [[Meeru Island]], North Male Atoll]]

Maldivian waters are home to several ecosystems, but are most noted for their variety of colourful [[coral reefs]], home to 1100 [[species]] of fish, 5 species of [[sea turtle]]s, 21 species of whales and dolphins, 187 species of corals, 400 species of molluscs, and 83 species of echinoderms. Many crustacean species are there as well: 120 copepod, 15 amphipod as well as over 145 crab and 48 shrimp species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mv/mv-nr-04-en.pdf |title=Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity of Maldives |publisher=Ministry of Housing and Environment |page=7 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many marine families represented are [[Pufferfish]], [[Caesionidae|Fusiliers]], [[Carangidae|Jackfish]], [[Lionfish]], [[Oriental Sweetlips]], reef sharks, [[Grouper]]s, [[Eel]]s, [[Lutjanidae|Snappers]], [[Bannerfish]], [[Batfish (disambiguation)|Batfish]], [[Humphead Wrasse]], [[Spotted Eagle Ray]]s, [[Scorpionfish]], [[Lobster]]s, [[Nudibranches]], [[Pomacanthidae|Angelfish]], [[Butterflyfish]], [[Squirrelfish]], [[Soldierfish]], [[Asiatic glassfish|Glassfish]], [[Surgeonfish]], [[Unicorn fish (disambiguation)|Unicornfish]], [[Triggerfish]], [[Napoleon wrasse]]s, and [[Barracuda]]s.&lt;ref name=scuba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scubadivemaldives.com/category/maldives-marine-life |title=Maldives Marine Life |publisher=Scubadivemaldives.com |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These coral reefs are home to a variety of marine ecosystems that vary from [[planktonic]] organisms to whale sharks. Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coral reefs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5627E/X5627E00.htm |title=Regional Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Coral Reefs |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as {{convert|5|C-change}} due to a single [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño phenomenon]] event caused [[coral bleaching]], killing ⅔ of the nation's coral reefs.&lt;ref name=Wheatley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |title=Maldives Nurses Its Coral Reefs Back to Life |publisher=Globalcoral.org |date=2 May 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921010958/http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from {{convert|20|–|60|ft}} below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than ordinary corals.&lt;ref name=Wheatley/&gt; Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Niño gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there for ever. Not only this, they also act as a natural barrier against the tropical storms, floods and tsunamis. Seaweeds grow on the skeletons of dead coral.&lt;ref name=scuba/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent scientific studies suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between neighbor atolls, especially in terms of benthic fauna. Differences in terms of fishing pressure (including poaching) could be the cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ducarme between&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frédéric Ducarme |date=2016 |title=Field observations of sea cucumbers in Ari Atoll, and comparison with two nearby atolls in Maldives |url=http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/BDM/36/BDM36_09_Ducarme.pdf |journal=SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin |publisher= |volume=36 |issue= |pages= |doi= |pmc= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President heads the executive branch and appoints the cabinet which is approved by the [[Majlis of the Maldives|People's Majlis (Parliament)]]. Following the introduction of a new constitution in 2008, direct elections for the President take place every five years, with a limit of two terms in office for any individual. The current President is [[Abdulla Yameen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassan sworn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/feb/07/maldives-vp-hassan-takes-oath-as-president/|title=Maldives' VP Hassan Takes Oath as President |agency=Associated Press |work=Time Magazine |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |location=Male, Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Majlis serve five-year terms, with the total number of members determined by atoll populations. At the [[Maldivian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]], 77 members were elected. The People's Majlis, located in Male, houses members from all over the country.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |title=Maldives Enthongraphy |publisher=Maldives-ethnography.com|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The republican constitution came into force in 1968, and was amended in 1970, 1972, and 1975. On 27 November 1997 it was replaced by another Constitution assented to by the President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom]]. This Constitution came into force on 1 January 1998. All stated that the [[President of the Maldives|president]] was the Head of State, Head of Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Maldives National Defence Force|Armed Forces]] and the Police of the Maldives. A third [[Constitution of the Maldives|Constitution]] was ratified in 2008, which separated the [[judiciary]] from the head of state.

===Law===
{{See also|Judiciary in the Maldives}}

According to the [[Constitution of Maldives]], &quot;the judges are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law. When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent, judges must consider Islamic [[Sharia|Shari'ah]]&quot;. Article 15 of the Act Number 1/81 (Penal Code) gives provision for [[hudud]] punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives Penal Code|url=http://www.agoffice.gov.mv/pdf/sublawe/PC1.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 156 of the constitution states that law includes the norms and provisions of sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/maldives.htm |title=Maldives |publisher=Law.emory.edu |date=16 March 1983 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam is the official religion of the Maldives and open practice of any other religion is forbidden and liable to prosecution. Article 2 of the revised constitution says that the republic &quot;is based on the principles of Islam&quot;. Article nine says that &quot;a non-Muslim may not become a citizen&quot;; article ten says that &quot;no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied&quot;. Article nineteen states that &quot;citizens are free to participate in or carry out any activity that is not expressly prohibited by sharia [Islamic law] or by the law&quot;.

The requirement to adhere to a particular religion and prohibition of public worship following other religions is contrary to Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and Article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] to which Maldives has recently become party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v3/?p=menu_item&amp;sub_id=21&amp;submenu=Human%20Rights%20and%20Democracy |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maldives |publisher=Foreign.gov.mv |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was addressed in Maldives' reservation in adhering to the Covenant claiming that &quot;The application of the principles set out in Article 18 of the Covenant shall be without prejudice to the Constitution of the Republic of the Maldives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Thomas W.

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in the Maldives}}

Human rights in the Maldive is a contentious issue, in its 2011 [[Freedom in the World]] report, [[Freedom House]] declared the Maldives &quot;Partly Free&quot;, claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled.&lt;ref name='FH 2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/maldives | title = Freedom in the World 2011: Maldives| accessdate = 25 August 2012 | author = [[Freedom House]] | year = 2011 | publisher = Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], and abuse and unequal treatment of women.&lt;ref name='State 2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid=186470 | title = Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011: Maldives | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | author = [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] | year = 2012 | publisher = [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of the Maldives}}

[[File:Maldivian Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim addressing an audience in Kochi.jpg|thumb|Former Maldivian Defense Minister [[Mohamed Nazim]] at an Indian naval base in [[Kochi]].]]
Since 1996, the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]]. In 2002, the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but {{As of|2008|lc=y}} had not applied for membership. Maldive's interest relates to its identity as a small island state, especially economic development and environmental preservation, and its desire for closer relations with France, a main actor in the IOC region. The Maldives is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], SAARC. The republic joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1982, some 17 years after gaining independence from Great Britain. The Maldives enjoys close ties with Commonwealth members [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]]. The Maldives and [[Comoros]] are also both members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

===Military===
{{main|Maldives National Defence Force}}

[[File:Maldives-vaixells de bombers.jpg|thumb|Fire &amp; Rescue Service boats.]]

The Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives, having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives, including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the maintenance of peace and security. The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.

As a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} × {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic view points.

The Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these function. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarization and handling of such hazardous situations.

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative divisions of the Maldives}}

[[File:Atolls of the maldives.png|thumb|right|Each administrative atoll is marked, along with the [[thaana]] letter used to identify the atoll. Natural atolls are labelled in light blue. [[Media:Atolls of the maldives.png|Full view of the map]].]]
The Maldives has twenty-six natural [[Atolls of the Maldives|atolls]] and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (twenty administrative atolls and [[Malé]] city).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umv.html |title=Maldives Atolls|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each atoll is administered by an elected Atoll Council. The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.

Between 2008 and 2010 the Maldives had 7 provinces each consisting of the following administrative divisions (the capital Malé is its own administrative division):
#[[Mathi-Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Haa Alif Atoll]], [[Haa Dhaalu Atoll]] and [[Shaviyani Atoll]].
#[[Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Noonu Atoll]], [[Raa Atoll]], [[Baa Atoll]] and [[Lhaviyani Atoll]].
#[[Medhu-Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Kaafu Atoll]], [[Alifu Alifu Atoll]], [[Alifu Dhaalu Atoll]] and [[Vaavu Atoll]].
#[[Medhu Province]]; consists of [[Meemu Atoll]], [[Faafu Atoll]] and [[Dhaalu Atoll]].
#[[Medhu-Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Thaa Atoll]] and [[Laamu Atoll]].
#[[Mathi-Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Gaafu Alifu Atoll]] and [[Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll]].
#[[Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Gnaviyani Atoll]] and [[Addu City]].

In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as &quot;[[Haa Alif]]&quot; for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most Atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Divehiraajjege Jōgrafīge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Economy==

{{main|Economy of the Maldives}}
[[File:The western side (382669110).jpg|thumb|left|Malé harbour]]
[[File:Maldives treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Maldives's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]

In ancient times the Maldives were renowned for [[cowry shell]]s, [[coir]] rope, dried [[tuna]] fish (Maldive Fish), [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi). Local and foreign trading ships used to load these products in Sri Lanka and transport them to other harbours in the Indian Ocean.

Historically Maldives provided enormous quantities of [[cowry]] shells, [[history of money|an international currency of the early ages]]. From the 2nd century AD the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJD94VZweCIC&amp;pg=PA9 | title=Maldives | author=Lyon, James  | date=October 2003 | publisher=Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd | page=9 | isbn=978-1-74059-176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'' were used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of [[Maldive Islands|Maldivian]] cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of [[slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986). ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]] ISBN 0521541107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cowry is now the symbol of the [[Maldives Monetary Authority]].

The Maldivian government began an [[economic reform]] program in 1989, initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalised regulations to allow more foreign investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year for more than a decade. Today, the Maldives' largest industry is tourism, accounting for 28% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is the second leading sector.

The Maldivian economy is to a large degree based on tourism. In late December 2004, the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|major tsunami]] [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives|left more than 100 dead]], 12,000 displaced, and property damage exceeding $400&amp;nbsp;million. As a result of the tsunami, the GDP contracted by about 3.6% in 2005. A rebound in tourism, post-tsunami reconstruction, and development of new resorts helped the economy recover quickly and showed an 18% increase on 2006. 2013 estimates show Maldivians enjoy the highest GDP (PPP) per capita $11,900 (2013 est) among south Asian countries.

Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour. Tourism gave a major boost to the country's fledgling traditional [[cottage industries]] such as mat weaving, [[lacquer]] work, [[handicraft]], and coir rope making. New industries that have since emerged include printing, production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], brick making, marine engine repairs, bottling of [[aerated water]], and garment production.

===Tourism===

[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue lagoons]]

{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives}}

The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 185 islands are home to its 300,000 inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos island resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup? What coup? Tourists ignore Maldives turmoil | date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which transformed the Maldives economy.

[[File:Landaa Giraavaru vue du ciel.JPG|thumb|The [[resort island]] of [[Landaa Giraavaru]] (Baa atoll)]]
According to the [[Ministry of Tourism (Maldives)|Ministry of Tourism]], the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. {{As of|2008}}, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/ |title=Ministry of Tourism. Retrieved 3 April 2009 |publisher=Tourism.gov.mv |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007. {{As of|2007}}, over 8,380,000 tourists had visited Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tourism.gov.mv/pubs/35_years_of_tourism_final.pdf |title=35 years of tourism |format=PDF |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Visitors to Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country.&lt;ref name=doi&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry into Maldives|url=http://www.immigration.gov.mv/index.php/entry-to-maldives.html|publisher=Department of Immigration and Emigration, Republic of Maldives|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most visitors arrive at [[Malé International Airport]], on [[Hulhulé]] Island, adjacent to the capital Malé. The airport is served by flights to India, Sri Lanka, [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], Singapore, Istanbul, and major airports in South-East Asia, as well as charters from Europe. [[Gan International Airport|Gan Airport]], on the southern atoll of [[Addu City|Addu]], also serves an international flight to [[Milan]] several times a week. British Airways offer direct flights to the Maldives around 2–3 times per week.

===Fishing industry===

{{main|Fishing industry in the Maldives}}
[[File:Doni aux Maldives cropped.jpg|thumb|A mechanised traditional inter island dhoni stripped of its sails]]

For many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other [[ocean|marine]] products. Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.

The [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programs began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.

{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].

==Demographics==

{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Malé]], the capital of the Maldives]]

The Maldivian ethnic identity is a blend of the cultures reflecting the peoples who settled on the islands, reinforced by religion and language. The earliest settlers were probably from [[southern India]] and Sri Lanka. They are linguistically and ethnically related to the people in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are ethnically known as [[Dhivehi people|Dhivehis]].

Some social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Instead of a complex [[caste]] system, there was merely a distinction between noble (bēfulhu) and common people in the Maldives. Members of the social elite are concentrated in Malé.

The population doubled by 1978, and the [[population growth]] rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islands by Population Size and Percentage Share of Total Population|url=http://www.planning.gov.mv/publications/census2006_island_level_tables/population/population/PP_05.htm|work=Maldives: Population and Housing Census 2006|publisher=Ministry of Planning and National Development|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrollment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census Analysis 2006.

As of April 2008, more than 70,000 foreign employees, along with 33,000 illegal immigrants, comprised more than one third of the Maldivian population.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013}}. There are 40,000 [[Bangladeshis]] in Maldives making them the largest group of foreigners working in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent-bangladesh.com/200808018336/country/maldives-to-recruit-bangladeshi-workers.html Maldives to recruit more Bangladeshi workers, SATURDAY, 02 AUGUST 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen today next to some old mosques and are considered today as [[cultural heritage]]. Other aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maulūdu ([[Mawlid]]) — the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone—existed until very recent times. These Maulūdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Sunni Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.

According to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named [[Abu al-Barakat]], sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of the Friday Mosque, or [[Malé Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Malé. Built in 1656, this is the country's oldest mosque.

===Languages===

The official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], an [[Indo-Aryan language]] having some similarities with [[Elu]], the ancient [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] language. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is [[Eveyla akuru]] script which is found in historical recording of kings ([[raadhavalhi]]). Later a script called [[Dhives akuru]] was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]]. English is used widely in commerce and increasingly in government schools.

[[File:Malé Mosque.JPG|thumb|The [[Islamic Centre (Maldives)|Islamic Centre]], housing the mosque ''Masjid-al-Sultan [[Mohammed Thakurufaanu-al-A'z'am]]'']]

Since the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the [[far east]] and the middle east. [[Somali people|Somali]] travellers discovered the island for gold in the 13th century, before the Portuguese. Their brief stay later ended in a bloody conflict known by the Somalis as &quot;Dagaal Diig Badaaney&quot; in 1424.

However, unlike the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka and most of the Arabs, Africans and Europeans whose influence can be seen in borrow-words, material culture, and the diversity of Maldivian phenotype, Maldivians do not have the highly embedded patriarchal codes of honor, purity, corporate marriage, and sedentary private property that are typical of places where agriculture is the key form of subsistence and social relations have been built, historically, around tribute taking.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesized, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

== Transportation ==
[[File:TMA Terminal.JPG|thumb|TMA Terminal]]
[[Ibrahim Nasir International Airport]] is the principal gateway to the Maldives. International travel is available on a number of major airlines. Two Maldives based airlines also operate international flights. Privately owned [[MEGA Maldives Airlines]] has Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft and operates frequent services to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all of Maldives domestic airports with several Dash-8 aircraft and one A320 with international service to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram, India, and Dhaka, Bangladesh.

In Maldives there are three main ways to move around: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives – Élite Diving Agency]. Elitedivingagency.com. Retrieved on 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For several years there were two seaplanes companies operating: TMA, [[Trans Maldivian Airways]], and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of DHC-6 &quot;Twin Otters.&quot; There is also another airline, flyMe, which operates using ATRs to domestic airports, principally Maamagili and some others. The typical Maldivian boat is called [[dhoni]]. Depending on the distance of the destination island to the airport, resorts organise domestic flight plus boat transfers, seaplane flights directly to the resort island jetty, or speedboat trips for their guests. There are also locally run ferries by large dhoni boats. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although longer, is relatively cheaper and convenient.

== Education ==

The [[Maldives National University]] was inaugurated on 15 February 2011. Previously known as the Maldives College of Higher Education, it was established on 1 January 1999, as part of a restructuring and rationalization of all government-run post-secondary education in Maldives. It is the only public degree-granting institution on the nation and offers a range of degrees, diplomas, and certificates, with particular emphasis on engineering, health science, education, tourism, and management.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnu.e&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnu.edu.mv|title=The Maldives National University – Home|publisher=mnu.edu.mv|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mascarene Islands''' (or '''Mascarenhas Archipelago''') is a group of [[island]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] east of [[Madagascar]] consisting of [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]] and [[Rodrigues]]. The collective title is derived from the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigator [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], who first visited them in the early sixteenth century. The islands share a common [[geologic]] origin in the volcanism of the [[Réunion hotspot]] beneath the [[Mascarene Plateau]] and form a distinct [[ecoregion]] with a unique flora and fauna.

==Location and description==
The [[archipelago]] comprises three large islands, [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], and [[Rodrigues]], plus a number of volcanic remnants in the tropics of the southwestern Indian Ocean, generally between 700 and 1500 kilometres east of Madagascar. The [[terrain]] includes a variety of [[reef]]s, [[atoll]]s, and small islands. They present various [[Topography|topographical]] and [[Edaphology|edaphic]] regions. On the largest islands these gave rise to unusual biodiversity. The [[Oceanic climate|climate is oceanic]] and [[Tropics|tropical]].

===Geology===
[[File:Piton de la Fournaise 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piton de la Fournaise]]]]
The islands are [[volcanic]] in origin; Saya de Malha (35 mya) was the first of the Mascarene islands to rise out of the Indian Ocean due to the [[Réunion hotspot]], followed by [[Nazareth Bank]] (some 2,000 years later), [[Soudan Bank]] and [[Cargados Carajos]]. The youngest islands to form were Mauritius (7–10 mya), the oldest of the existing islands, created along with the undersea Rodrigues ridge. The islands of Rodrigues and Réunion were created in the last two million years. Réunion is the largest of the islands (2,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), followed by Mauritius (1,900&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Rodrigues (110&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Eventually Saya de Malha, Nazareth and Soudan were completely submerged, Cargados Carajos remaining as a coral atoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emmanuel Van Heygen |url=http://www.phelsumania.com/public/articles/biogeography_dispersal_mascarenes.html |title=Dispersal of the Genus Phelsuma in the Mascarenes |publisher=Phelsumania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Réunion hotspot was beginning to cool and Rodrigues came out as a tiny island. Had erosion not taken place, Cargados Carajos would have been a large volcanic island, and the Mascarenes would have been an archipelago of seven or more (counting Saya De Malha, Nazareth and Soudan) large, populated islands, rather than the three (Mauritius, Reunion, Rodrigues) that remain today.

Réunion is home to the highest peaks in the Mascarenes, the [[shield volcano]]es [[Piton des Neiges]] (3,069 m) and [[Piton de la Fournaise]] (2,525 m). Piton de la Fournaise, on the southeastern corner of Réunion, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting last on 2 January 2010. [[Piton de la Petite Rivière Noire]] (828 m) is the highest peak on Mauritius, and the gentle hills of Rodrigues rise to only 390 m.

The [[Mascarene Plateau]] is an undersea plateau that extends approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;km, from the [[Seychelles]] to Réunion. The plateau covers an area of over 115,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of shallow water, with depths ranging from 8 to 150 meters, plunging to 4000 m to the [[abyssal plain]] at its edges. The southern part of the plateau, including the [[Saya de Malha Bank]], [[Nazareth Bank]], [[Soudan Banks]] and [[Cargados Carajos]] Shoals (Saint Brandon) (then one large island), was formed by the Réunion hotspot. These were once volcanic islands, much like Mauritius and Réunion, which have now sunk or eroded to below sea level or, in the case of the Cargados Carajos, to low coral islands. The Saya de Malha Bank formed 35 million years ago, and the Nazareth Bank and the Cargados Carajos shoals after that. [[Limestone]] banks found on the plateau are the remnants of [[coral reef]]s, indicating that the plateau was a succession of islands. Some of the banks may have been islands as recently as 18,000–6,000 years ago, when sea levels were as much as 130 meters lower during the most recent [[ice age]].

==Flora==
[[File:Hoefnagel dodo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[dodo]] was a frugivore giant columbiforme of [[Mauritius]] Island where there are several [[Ocotea]] species. Painted by [[Jacob Hoefnagel]], c. 1602]]

The habitats of the islands differ in size, topography, age, and in proximity to the nearest major land mass, namely (Madagascar). As is common among remote islands, the Mascarene fauna and flora display a high degree of [[endemism]]; they include over a thousand species of which several hundred are endemic.  There also are many introduced species but until Europeans first settled the islands in the sixteenth century the Mascarenes are not known to have harboured any human populations, so much of the island's wildlife, which would have gone extinct much earlier had any native people lived there, was still flourishing during the early days of settlement.

In prehistoric times the islands were covered in a diverse range of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]]. At present however, though the Mascarene islands form a distinct [[ecoregion]], known as the ''[[Biodiversity of the Mascarene islands|Mascarene forests]]'', the ecoregion is not homogeneous, and comprises at least five fairly distinct vegetation zones that reflect variations in altitude and in moisture regime.

The freshwater [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] includes coastal [[wetland]]s and [[swamp forest]]s, grading into rainforest to windward and to lowland dry forest to leeward. Dryland areas include palm [[savanna]]s, [[Montane ecology|montane]] deciduous forests and heathlands on the highest peaks of Réunion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;&gt;[http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe1/Site_Thebaud/Publications_files/EoI_Mascarene_preprint2.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry lowland forests]] range from sea level to elevations of some 200 metres. They occur in regions with less than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm average annual rainfall. These dry lowland forests  are dominated by palms such as [[Latania]] species and [[Dictyosperma album]], and by the palm-like screw-pines ([[Pandanus]] species). There also are sclerophyllous trees such as species in the family [[Combretaceae]], for example [[Terminalia bentzoe]] &lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

Semi-dry [[sclerophyllous]] [[forests]] occur between the coastal areas and an altitude of 360 metres on Mauritius and Rodrigues. On Réunion only small relict patches remain at altitudes up to 750 metres on the western slopes. This semi-dry ecosystem occurs where the average annual rainfall is about 1000–1500&amp;nbsp;mm. Characteristic families of the flora in the include [[Ebenaceae]], with [[ebony]] species in the genus [[Diospyros]]. Other tree families are occurring such as [[Pleurostylia]] spp. ([[Celastraceae]]), [[Foetidia]] spp.  ([[Lecythidaceae]]), [[Olea europea]] subsp. africana ([[Oleaceae]]), Cossinia pinnata ([[Sapindaceae]]), Dombeya spp.  (Sterculiaceae), and a variety of Sapotaceae species [[Sideroxylon boutonianum]], [[Sideroxylon borbonicum]] spp. and [[Mimusops]]. The ecosystem is also home to several spectacular endemic species of [[Hibiscus]] ([[Malvaceae]]) [[Zanthoxylum]]  spp. ([[Rutaceae]]),  Obetia  ﬁcifolia ([[Urticaceae]]), and Scolopia heterophylla ([[Flacourtiaceae]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

The [[lowland rainforests]] are characterized by dense [[evergreen]] forests, with a canopy exceeding 30 meters. With an average annual rainfall of 1500–6000&amp;nbsp;mm, occur on Mauritius island above 360 m and all over the eastern lowlands from the coast to 800–900 m and, on the western side. On Réunion island the Lowland rainforests is present from 750 to 1100 m. These
forests have a canopy of tall trees up to 30 m high and represent the more diversified plant communities of the Mascarene Islands. Characteristic plants include trees in the plant family [[Sapotaceae]] e.g. [[Mimusops]] spp. [[Labourdonnaisia]] spp., [[Hernandiaceae]] [[Hernandia mascarenensis]], [[Clusiaceae]] [[Calophyllum]] spp., and [[Myrtaceae]] [[Syzygium]] spp., [[Eugenia]] spp., [[Sideroxylon]] spp., [[Monimiastrum]] spp.; shrubs in the plant family Rubiaceae (Gaertnera spp., Chassalia spp., Bertiera spp., Coffea spp.); [[bamboo]]s as [[Nastus borbonicus]], numerous species of orchids (e.g.,  Angraecum spp.,  Bulbophyllum spp.) and ferns e.g., Asplenium spp., Hymenophyllum spp., Trichomanes spp., Elaphoglossum spp., Marattia fraxinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

The [[cloud forest]]s, a dense type of hygrophilous rainforest, occur on Réunion between 800 and 1900 m on eastern slopes with an average annual rainfall 2000–10,000&amp;nbsp;mm, and between 1100 and 2000 m on western slopes with an average annual rainfall 2000–3000&amp;nbsp;mm and are also restricted to a small area of Mauritius around the montane area &quot;Montagne Cocotte&quot; above 750 m on Mauritius with an average annual rainfall 4500–5500&amp;nbsp;mm.  These type of forests is present on both islands with a canopy of 6 to 10 m high. They are rich in [[epiphyte]]s (orchids, ferns, mosses, lichens), emergent [[tree fern]]s (Cyathea spp.), and, originally, palms ([[Acanthophoenix rubra]]), but these now survive only in areas of Réunion where [[poaching]] has not wiped them out. Untransformed cloud forests still cover large areas on Réunion with 44,000 ha in 2005.
These forests are characterized by trees such as Dombeya spp., on the Réunion island only, and species in the plant family Monimiaceae (Monimia spp., Tambourissa spp.) as canopy species, with small trees and shrubs sucth as Psiadia spp. (Asteraceae) and Melicope spp. (Rutaceae) in the understory. They also include large areas of three monodominant plant communities, forests with Acacia heterophylla (Fabaceae) as canopy species that are very similar to Acacia koa forests in [[Hawaii]], thickets dominated by Erica reunionensis (Ericaceae), or hyperhumid screw-pine forest (Pandanus montanus).&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

The [[subalpine scrub]] with an average annual rainfall 2000–6000&amp;nbsp;mm is above the tree line to 1800–2000 m, at elevations where frosts occur regularly in winter, dominated by shrubs in the plant families of [[Ericaceae]] (Erica spp.), [[Asteraceae]] (Hubertia spp., Psiadia spp.,  Stoebe passerinoides), and [[Rhamnaceae]] (Phylica nitida), with some notable endemic species suchs Heterochaenia rivalsii (Campanulaceae), Eriotrix commersonii ([[Asteraceae]]), and Cynoglossum borbonicum ([[Boraginaceae]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

The summits of the [[volcano]]es are covered by large mineral areas with sparse grasslands rich in endemic grasses (Poaceae, e.g., Festuca borbonica, Agrostis salaziensis, Pennisetum caffrum) and orchids (Orchidaceae, e.g.,  Disa borbonica), ericoid thickets, or thickets of the small tree Sophora denudata ([[Fabaceae]]), depending on substrate texture and age.&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

Finally the Mascarene Islands are surrounded by approximately 750 square km  of coral reef. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels, whereas Mauritius is surrounded by a discontinuous fringing reef and a small barrier reef. In contrast, Réunion has very short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along the western and southwestern coasts only. The islets of the Cargados Carajos Shoals, which have a very depauperate terrestrial biota owing to being so low-lying and swamped during cyclones, are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef, which accounts for ∼30% of the reefs of the Mascarene Islands. Lagoon reefs and reef ﬂats are dominated by scleractinian corals such as branching and tabular  Acropora,  Porites  massives, foliaceous Montipora and Pavona, and sand consolidated with beds of seagrass such Halophila spp. ([[Hydrocharitaceae]]).
Among coral reef ﬁ shes, wrasses (Labridae), damselﬁsh (Pomacentridae), carnivorous groupers ([[Serranidae]]), and [[surgeonﬁshes]] ([[Acanthuridae]]) have many species.&lt;ref name=&quot;ups-tlse1&quot;/&gt;

Most of the indigenous Mascarene flora and fauna are thought to have descended originally from [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] and [[Africa]]n ancestors.   The Mascarenes are home to many endemic species of [[Dombeyoideae]], the [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus [[Psiloxylon]] (''[[Psiloxylon|Psiloxylon mauritianum]]''), and members of the family [[Monimiaceae]], [[Escalloniaceae]] and [[Foetidia]].  Indigenous trees for example include species in the genera [[Ocotea]], [[Erythrina]], [[Sideroxylon]] and several species of palms in the genus [[Hyophorbe]].  Ferns are prominent components of the biotas of the islands, especially in the tropical forest. Most ferns disperse easily via [[Seed dispersal|ornithochory]] of their spores, allowing fairly frequent colonization from Madagascar and exchange among the Mascarene islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=50c160d51b144d349e6b4916daaf0808&amp;SourceDatabaseId=018774364ea94468b3f4dec24aa1ee53 |title=MASCARENES FERNS - Investigating the fern diversity of the Mascarene Islands using phylogeographic approaches |publisher=Ist-world.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other endemic families include the [[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]] and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]] (with [[psiloxylaceae]] ). The four largest families present in the Mascarene Islands are: [[Myrtaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], [[Orchidaceae]], and [[Euphorbiaceae]], they comprise between 193 and 223 species each, for a total of 831 species, or 26.9% of the flowering plant flora. Another seven families contain 80 or more species each: [[Poaceae]], [[Apocynaceae]], [[Cyperaceae]], [[Cunoniaceae]], [[Rutaceae]], [[Araliaceae]], and [[Sapotaceae]], representing an additional ca. 660 species in all, 21.3% of the angiosperm flora. Some families that have few species, but are distributed too in the Americas, showing its ancient related origin, are typically in wet areas and occur as relict species in wet Islands wideworld, with several families including [[Phyllanthaceae]], [[Hernandiaceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Ebenaceae]] with Mauritius ebony, [[Diospyros tesselaria]].

The increasing disappearance of young calvaria trees, is suggested due to ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' [[tortoises]], [[fruit bat]]s or the [[broad-billed parrot]] could have been  dispersing the seeds.

The [[Tambalacoque]] (''Sideroxylon grandiflorum''), often called the dodo tree, is also threatened with extinction, although this is principally as a result of unripened seed destruction by the introduced crab-eating macaque (''Macaca fascicularis'') rather than any connection to a reliance on the dodo to assist with seed germination after the seeds passed through the extinct bird's digestive tract.

In the Mascarenes, the angiosperms with 22 species have 21 endemic. The endemic [[Dombeyoideae]] from the Mascarenes are polyphyletic and split into nine clades. [[Trochetia]] appears monophyletic and more closely related to [[Eriolaena]] and [[Helmiopsis]] than to [[Dombeya]]. All Dombeya taxa are included in a clade together with [[Ruizia]] and [[Astiria]], this means that Dombeya is paraphyletic. In terms of breeding systems the Malagasy Dombeyoideae are hermaphroditic, whereas those of the Mascarenes are considered dioecious. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests that dioecy has been acquired several times. At least five colonization events from Madagascar to the Mascarene archipelago were produced. The evolutionary history of two lineages of Mascarene Domeyoideae seems to be related to adaption to xeric habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2009/00000058/00000002/art00016 |title=ingentaconnect Systematics of Dombeyoideae (Malvaceae) in the Mascarene archipel |publisher=Ingentaconnect.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Indeed, much of the Mascarenes' native fauna has become endangered or extinct since the human settlement of the islands in the 17th century. Settlers cleared most of the forests for agriculture and grazing, and introduced many exotic species, including [[pig]]s, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[mongoose]]s.

Many of the Mascarene birds evolved into flightless forms; the most famous of which was the [[extinct]] flightless [[pigeon]], the [[dodo]] of Mauritius.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1786, sub-fossil bones were discovered in a cave which confirmed [[Leguat]]'s descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen living birds. The star [[constellation]] [[Turdus Solitarius]] was named after this bird.

Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were also once each home to one or more species of [[giant tortoises]], now extinct, which comprised the genus ''[[Cylindraspis]]''. There are thirteen living endemic reptile species, including a number of species of day [[gecko]]es ([[genus]] ''[[Phelsuma]]'').

The islands have no native [[mammal]]s, except for [[bat]]s such as the [[Mauritian flying fox]].

==Wildlife - Threats and preservation==
Today Mauritius has one of the highest population densities in the world and on all of the islands, there has been a great loss of habitat and many of the surviving endemic species are still threatened with extinction with little protection. Less than 40 percent of Réunion is covered with natural vegetation, only about 5 percent of Mauritius, and almost none of Rodrigues. On Réunion, forest has been cleared for agriculture and then overtaken by introduced plants. Mauritius was largely converted to sugar cane, tea, and conifer plantations. On Rodrigues the damage has been done by shifting cultivation.

{{See also|History of Mauritius}}
The early colonial history of the islands, like that of the Caribbean, is a confusing story of takeovers between the rival Portuguese, Dutch, French and British colonizers, usually separate or in varying combinations, sometimes even with distant other colonies, e.g. in the East Indies.

Around 1507, the explorer Mascarenhas discovered the island group which bears his name. The area remained under nominal Portuguese rule until [[Étienne de Flacourt]] arrived with a French naval squadron and took possession in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islands in the southern Indian Ocean westward of Longitude 80 degrees east, including Madagascar |last=Moriarty |first=Cpt.

On 14 July 1767 this became a French crown colony, still under one governor general. From 3 February 1803 till 2 September 1810 the French colony of [[Indes-Orientales]], under a ''[[capitaine général]]'' (captain-general), included Réunion and (nominally) the  Seychelles.

===Mauritius===
{{unreferenced section|date = July 2014}}
[[Mauritius]] was formed 8–10 million years ago, and is geographically one of the oldest remaining islands in the group. It was discovered in the 10th century by the Arabs and was first named Dina Harobi, but the first permanent settlement was by the Dutch in 1638. It was seized by France in 1715, who remained in control of it until the British took over in 1810. Mauritius gained independence in 1968.

===Rodrigues===
{{unreferenced section|date = July 2014}}
[[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] was formed at around the same time as Reunion. It was first discovered by the [[Arabs]] but named after Portuguese navigator [[Diogo Rodrigues]]. It was under Dutch control in 1601 and settled by the French in 1691. Britain took possession of Rodrigues in 1809. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Rodrigues was forcefully joined to it.{{discuss}} Rodrigues remains an autonomous region of Mauritius.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

===Réunion===
[[Réunion]] was discovered first by the Arabs then by the Portuguese, who named it Santa Apolónia. It was then occupied by the French as part of Mauritius. It was first inhabited by French mutineers who arrived on the island between 1646 and 1669.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/14363/HERMES_2002_32-33_91.pdf?sequence=1|title=De Bourbon a la Reunion, L'Historie D'une Ile|publisher=Documents.irevues.inist.fr|language=fr|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given its current name in 1793. From 1810 to 1815 it was held by the British, before being returned to France. Réunion became an overseas [[Departments of France|department]] of France in 1946.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

===Cargados Carajos===
[[Cargados Carajos]] is the remnant of one or more large volcanic islands which sank with the rising tides. Today it is administered by Mauritius.

===Saya de Malha===
[[Saya de Malha Bank]] is a large, [[submerged bank]]. Prehistorically it was a group of volcanic islands, and was joined to the [[Great Chagos Bank]] until continental drift pushed them apart.

===Soudan Banks===
[[Soudan Banks]] are a group of low-lying banks on the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

===Nazareth Bank===
[[Nazareth Bank]] is located just north of Cargados Carajos, and prehistorically they were a single geological feature. Today it is a large, shallow fishing bank.

The '''Nicobar Islands''' are an [[archipelago|archipelagic]] island chain in the eastern [[Indian Ocean]] and one of the most isolated in the world. They are located in [[Southeast Asia]], 150&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Aceh]] on [[Sumatra]], and separated from [[Thailand]] to the east by the [[Andaman Sea]]. Located 1,300&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the [[Indian subcontinent]], across the [[Bay of Bengal]], they form part of the [[Union Territory]] of [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], [[India]].

[[UNESCO]] has declared the islands as one of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Unesco&quot;&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/multimedia/photos/mab-2013/], The International Coordinating Council of UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), added the following new sites to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/multimedia/photos/mab-2013/india/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and population==

The Nicobar Islands cover a land area of 1,648.13&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and had a population of 36,844 at the 2011 Census. They comprise three distinct groups:
 
'''[[Car Nicobar Subdivision|Northern Group]]''':
* [[Car Nicobar]]
* Battimaly

'''[[Nancowry Subdivision|Central Group]]''':
* [[Chowra]], Chaura or Sanenyo 
* [[Teressa (Nicobar Islands)|Teressa]] or Luroo
* [[Bompuka]] or Poahat
* [[Katchal Island|Katchal]]
* [[Camorta Island|Camorta]]
* [[Nancowry Island|Nancowry]] or Nancowrie 
* [[Trinket Island|Trinket]]
* [[Man Island (Nicobar)|Laouk]] or &quot;Isle of Man&quot;
* [[Tillangchong]]

'''[[Great Nicobar Subdivision|Southern Group]]''' (Sambelong):
* [[Great Nicobar]] (922&amp;nbsp;km², largest island of the Nicobars)
* [[Little Nicobar]] 
* [[Kondul Island]]
* [[Pulo Milo]] or Pillomilo (Milo Island)
* Meroe, Trak, Treis, Menchal, Kabra, Pigeon and Megapod

Indira Point (6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E) is the southernmost point of the Great Nicobar Island and India itself, about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].

The Nicobar Islands are part of a great [[island arc]] created by the collision of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] with [[Eurasia]]. The collision lifted the [[Himalayas]] and most of the Indonesian islands, and created a long arc of highlands and islands, which includes the [[Arakan Yoma]] range of [[Burma]], the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and the islands off the west coast of [[Sumatra]], including the [[Banyak Islands]] and [[Mentawai Islands]].

===Ecology===
The climate is warm and tropical, with temperatures ranging from 22 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C. Rainfall is heavy due to annual monsoons and measures around 3000 to 3800&amp;nbsp;mm each year. The vegetation of the Nicobars is typically divided into the coastal [[mangrove]] forests and the interior evergreen and deciduous [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]]. Additionally, several islands contain extensive inland [[grassland]]s, though these are thought to result from human intervention.

The Nicobar Islands are recognized as a distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]], the '''Nicobar Islands rain forests''', with many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species.

As a result of lower sea levels during the [[ice age]]s, the Andaman Islands were linked to the Southeast Asian mainland, but it is not believed that the Nicobar Islands ever had a land bridge to the continent. Lower sea levels did link the islands to one another: Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar were linked to each other, and Nancowry, Chaura, Katchall, Trinka, Camorta, and the nearby smaller islands were linked to one another as well.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The Nicobar Islands are believed to have been inhabited for thousands of years. Six indigenous [[Nicobarese languages]] are spoken on the islands, which are part of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer branch]] of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]], which includes [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages of [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Munda languages]] of India. An indigenous tribe living at the southern tip of Great Nicobar, called the [[Shompen people|Shompen]], may be of [[Mesolithic]] Southeast Asian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Origin of the name ===
The earliest extant references to the name &quot;Nicobar&quot; is in the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Pali]] [[Buddhist]] chronicles, the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (c. 3rd or 4th century CE) and the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (c. 4th or 5th century), which state that the children of the followers of the legendary founder of the Sri Lankan Kingdom, Vijaya, landed on ''Naggadipa'' (the island of the children, from the Pali '''nagga''' meaning 'naked').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Mahavamsa or The Great Chronicle of Ceylon| author=Wilhelm Geiger (Tr)| year=1912 | accessdate=  8 July 2013| publisher=Pali Text Society | url=http://what-buddha-said.net/library/pdfs/mahavamsa.geiger.pdf| quote= ''P54 &quot;The island where the children landed was called Naggadipa...&quot; N: &quot;l That is,'Island of children', from nagga 'naked'...&quot; ''| isbn= 81-206-0218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern name is likely derived from the [[Chola dynasty]] name for the islands, '''''Nakkavaram''''' or ''''Puup Pii'''' (literally, &quot;naked man&quot; in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) which is inscribed on the [[Thanjavur]] (Tanjore) inscription of 1050 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Ancient Jaffna| author=C Rasanayagam| year=1926 | accessdate=  | publisher=Asian Educational Society (reprint)| url=| quote= ''P53 &quot;Naggadipa, where the children are alleged to have landed, is certainly Nicobars, the Nakkavaram of the Tamils, ...''| isbn= 81-206-0210-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keay2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=India: A History | author=John Keay | year=2001 | accessdate= | publisher=Grove Press | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibLUu6RlvqwC | quote=''... and 'Nakkavaram' certainly represents the Nicobar islands ...'' | isbn=978-0-8021-3797-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica | year=1998 | accessdate = 2008-11-16 | publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica | url=https://books.google.com/?id=abRYAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

=== Colonial period ===
The history of organised European [[colonisation]] on the islands began with the [[Danish East India Company]] in 1754/56. During this time they were  administrated from [[Tranquebar]] (in continental [[Danish India]]) administrated under the name of '''Frederiksøerne'''; missionaries from the [[Moravian Church]] Brethren's settlement in [[Tranquebar]] attempted a settlement on [[Nancowry Island|Nancowry]] and died in great numbers from disease; the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of [[malaria]]: 1784–1807/09, 1830–1834 and finally from 1848 gradually for good. Between 1778 and 1783, [[William Bolts]] attempted to establish an Austrian colony on the islands on the mistaken assumption that [[Denmark–Norway]] had abandoned its claims to the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColVoy&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italy]] made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1868. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce [[Luigi Torelli]] started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the unexpected end of his Office and the [[:it:Governo La Marmora I|first La Marmora Cabinet]]. The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again.&lt;ref&gt;Ministero della Guerra, Ufficio Storico, Storia Militare della Colonia Eritrea, Vol. I, Roma 1935, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]]'s presence in the islands ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;ColVoy&quot; /&gt; which in 1869 made them part of [[British India]].

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the islands were [[Invasion and occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II|occupied by Japan between 1942 and 1945]].

===Indian state===
Together with the Andaman Islands, they became a [[union territory]] of India in 1950.

==26 December 2004 tsunami==
On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Nicobar Islands was devastated by a 10–15 m high [[tsunami]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. At least 6,000 people were killed on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] with reports putting the death toll on Katchal Island alone at 4,600.

Several islands were heavily damaged with initial reports of islands broken in two or three pieces and coral reefs moved above water. Teressa Island was said to have been split into two pieces and Trinkat Island into three pieces. Some estimates said that the islands were moved as much as 100 feet (30 m) by the earthquake and tilted.

[[Indira Point]] subsided 4.25 m and the lighthouse there was damaged.

==World Biosphere Reserve==
On 31 May 2013 it was reported that Nicobar Islands have been declared as [[World Biosphere Reserve]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=''Nicobar Islands declared as world biosphere reserve''|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2013-05-31|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Nicobar-Islands-declared-as-world-biosphere-reserve/articleshow/20358478.cms|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
*Airport: [[Car Nicobar]] CBD/VECX has an airstrip on [[Car Nicobar Air Force Base]] of 2717 by 43 meters on the South East coast near Malacca but does not offer commercial service.  [[Great Nicobar]] has a small airstrip of approximately 1000 meters at Campbell Bay/Tenlaa on its East coast.
*Seaport: At least one small shipping dock is located in Campbell Bay on the East coast of [[Great Nicobar]].  [[Car Nicobar]] has a small dock at its Northern tip near Keating Point and Mus.

The '''Prince Edward Islands''' are two small islands in the [[sub-antarctic]] [[Indian Ocean]] that are part of [[South Africa]]. The islands are named '''Marion Island''' (''named after [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]]'') and '''Prince Edward Island''' (named after [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]).

The islands in the group have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003, and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=John|title=ANTARCTICA AND ISLANDS – Background Research Paper produced for the South Africa Environment Outlook report on behalf of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism|url=http://soer.deat.gov.za/dm_documents/Antarctica_and_Islands_-_Background_Paper_1DXK5.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2010|date=June 2006|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1993 United Nations list of national parks and protected areas|year=1993|publisher=World Conservation Monitoring Centre, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Commission on Natural Parks and Protected Areas, United Nations Environment Programme|isbn=2-8317-0190-2|page=173|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/1993unitednation93worl#page/173/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only human inhabitants of the islands are the staff of a [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[biology|biological]] research station run by the [[South African National Antarctic Programme]] on Marion Island.

== Geography and geology ==
The island group is about {{convert|955|nmi|km mi|abbr=on|lk=in}} south-east of [[Port Elizabeth]] in mainland South Africa. [[Marion Island]] ({{Coord|46|54|45|S|37|44|37|E|type:isle|name=Marion Island}}), the larger of the two, is {{convert|25.03|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|16.65|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide with an area of {{convert|290|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a coastline of some {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}}, most of which is high cliffs. The highest point on Marion Island is [[Mascarin Peak]] (formerly State President Swart Peak), reaching {{convert|1242|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Boot Rock is about {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} off the northern coast.

[[File:Prince Edward Island, South Africa, EO-1 ALI satellite image, 5 May 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Edward Island]]
Prince Edward Island ({{Coord|46|38|39|S|37|56|36|E|type:isle|name=Prince Edward Island}}) is much smaller—only about {{convert|45|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10.23|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6.57|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide—and lies some {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}} to the north-east of Marion Island. At the [[Eduard Meine van Zinderen-Bakker|van Zinderen Bakker]] Peak north-west of the center, it reaches a height of {{convert|672|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=11343 Peakbagger – Van Zinderen Bakker Peak, South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few offshore rocks along the northern coast, like Ship Rock ({{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, north of northernmost point) and Ross Rocks ({{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, from the shore).

[[File:Marion Island, South Africa, EO-1 ALI satellite image, 5 May 2009.jpg|thumb|Marion Island]]
Both islands are of [[volcanic]] origin. Marion Island is one of the peaks of a large underwater [[shield volcano]] that rises some {{convert|5000|m|ft|0}} from the sea floor to the top of Mascarin Peak. The volcano is active, with eruptions having occurred between 1980 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;gvp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Marion Island|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=234070 |publisher=[[Global Volcanism Program]]|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The islands have a [[tundra climate]]. They lie directly in the path of eastward-moving depressions all year round and this gives them an unusually cool and windy climate. Strong winds blow almost every day of the year and the prevailing wind direction is north-westerly. Annual rainfall averages from {{convert|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} up to over {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} on Mascarin Peak.

It [[rain]]s on average about 320 days a year (about 28 days a month) and the islands are among the cloudiest places in the world; About 1300 hours a year of sunshine occurs on the sheltered eastern side of Marion Island but only around 800 away from the coast and on the wet western sides of Marion and Prince Edward Islands.

Summer and winter have fairly similar climates with cold winds and threat of snow or frost at any time of the year. However, the mean temperature in February (midsummer) is {{convert|7.7|°C|°F}} and in August (midwinter) it is {{convert|3.9|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;General Survey of Climatology, V12 (2001), Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GISS Climate data averages for 1978 to 2007, source – GHCN&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
The islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands. In this cold climate, plants are mainly limited to grasses and [[moss]]es, while [[lichen]]s are the most visible [[fungi]]. The main indigenous animals are insects along with large populations of [[seabird]]s, [[Pinniped|seal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marionseals.com |title=Marion Island Marine Mammal Programme |publisher=Marionseals.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=an1104|name=Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters surrounding the islands are often frequented by several species of whale, especially [[orca]]s, which prey on penguins and seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marionkillerwhales.com |title=Marion Island Killer Whales |publisher=Marionkillerwhales.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large whales such as [[southern right whale|southern rights]] and [[humpback whale|southern humpbacks]], and other Antarctic seals such as [[leopard seal]]s are seen more sporadic but their actual presences within the islands have been rather unclear due to biased timing and focused objectives of conducted surveys, aside from declining of each species.&lt;ref name=MarionResearch&gt;{{cite journal|authors=M. Postma, M. Wege, M.N.

The wildlife is particularly vulnerable to [[introduced species]] and one particular problem has been cats. In 1949, five domestic [[cat]]s were brought to Marion Island to deal with a [[mouse]] problem in the station. The cats multiplied quickly, and by 1977 there were approximately 3,400 cats on the island, feeding on burrowing [[petrel]]s instead of mice, threatening to drive the birds to extinction on the island.  Some species of petrels became extinct on Marion Island, and a &quot;cat eradication program&quot; was established. A few cats were intentionally infected with the highly specific [[feline panleukopenia]] virus, which reduced the cat population to about 600 by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/meid:158214/pmid |title=Dynamics of a feline virus with two transmission modes within exponentially growing host populations|author= K Berthier, M Langlais, P Auger, D Pontier |publisher=BioInfoBank Library|date=22 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining cats were killed by nocturnal shooting, and in 1991 only eight cats were trapped in a 12-month period. It is believed that no cats remain on Marion Island today.

[[File:Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn by Sir William Beechey.jpg|thumb|right|145px|[[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]], after whom the islands are named]]
The islands were discovered on 4 March 1663 by Barent Barentszoon Lam of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ship ''Maerseveen'' and were named ''Dina'' (Prince Edward) and ''Maerseveen'' (Marion).&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Arend Leupe: De eilanden Dina en Maerseveen in den Zuider Atlantischen Oceaan; in: Verhandelingen en berigten betrekkelijk het zeewezen, de zeevaartkunde, de hydrographie, de koloniën en de daarmede in verband staande wetenschappen, Jg. 1868, Deel 28, Afd. 2, [No.] 9; Amsterdam 1868 (pp. 242–253); cf. {{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Jeff|title=Antarctica|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-549-9|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;btinternet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~sa_sa/marion_island/marion_island_history.html |title=Marion Island, South Indian Ocean |publisher=Btinternet.com |date=29 June 2003 |accessdate=2012-10-09|archiveurl=http://archive.is/LELa|archivedate=2012-07-29}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1772, [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]] visited the islands&lt;ref name=&quot;keller&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Conrad|title=Madagascar, Mauritius and the other East-African islands|year=1901|publisher=S.

He named the islands  ''Terre de l'Espérance'' (Marion) and ''Ile de la Caverne'' (Pr. Edward).&lt;ref name=&quot;btinternet.com&quot;/&gt; In 1776, his expedition, now headed by his second-in-command, Jules Crozet, after the death of du Fresne, met [[James Cook]] in [[Cape Town]]. Cook subsequently set sail for the islands, but was unable to attempt a landing because of bad weather. Cook named&lt;ref name=&quot;keller&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/c/cook/james/c77n/chapter6.html James Cook]&lt;/ref&gt; the smaller island after [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]], the fourth son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], and to the larger gave the name of [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The first recorded landing was either in 1799 by a group of French [[seal (mammal)|seal]] hunters of the ''Sally'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mills |first=William J. |date=2003 |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;pg=PA531 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=531 |isbn=1576074226 |accessdate=2014-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or else in late 1803 by a group of seal hunters led by American captain Henry Fanning of the ''Catharine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanap.ac.za&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanap.ac.za/sanap_marion/marion_history.html |title=Marion Island – History |publisher=Sanap.ac.za |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These sealers, however, found signs of earlier human occupation, probably other sealers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[James Clark Ross]] also visited the islands in 1840 but was also unable to land.  In June 1849 the brig Richard Dart, with a troop of Royal Engineers under Lt. James Liddell, was wrecked on the island; only 10 of the 63 on board survived to be rescued by elephant seal hunters from Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Gazette/Accidents/Richard_Dart_Wreck.html Wreck of the troopship Richard Dart]&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the islands were surveyed by Captain [[George Nares]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John |last=Cooper |year=2008 |chapter=Human history |editor-first1=Steven L. |editor-last1=Chown |editor-first2=Pierre William |editor-last2=Froneman |title=The Prince Edward Islands: Land-sea Interactions in a Changing Ecosystem |location=Stellenbosch, South Africa |publisher=Sun Press |pages=331–350, page 336 |isbn=978-1-920109-85-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the [[British government]], assuming ownership of the islands, granted William Newton the rights to exploit [[guano]] deposits for the next twenty-one years. Also in 1908, shipwrecked hunters established a village at the north coast, called Fairbairn Settlement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} A ten-year grant for seal exploitation was issued by the British to a sealing company in 1926.

[[File:Marion Island.png|thumb|left|Logo of Marion Island]]
In late 1947 and early 1948, South Africa, with Britain's agreement, annexed the islands and installed the [[meteorology|meteorological]] station on Transvaal Cove on the north-east coast of Marion Island.  The research station was soon enlarged and today researches the [[biology]] of the islands, in particular the birds ([[penguin]]s, [[petrel]]s, [[albatross]]es, [[gull]]s) and seals. Today, the research station is called RSA Marion Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-46.876024,37.858769&amp;spn=0.003348,0.006518&amp;t=h&amp;z=18 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 1979, the [[Vela Incident]] occurred. One of the US [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites used to monitor compliance with the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] recorded an [[Vela Incident|event]] near the Prince Edward Islands that had the characteristic &quot;double flash&quot; signature of a small nuclear test.  However it was never proven conclusively if this was a nuclear test or not, so the event remains controversial.

== Legal status ==
Marion Island and Prince Edward Island were claimed for South Africa on 29 December 1947 and 4 January 1948 respectively, by a [[South African Navy]] force from [[Loch-class frigate#South African Navy|HMSAS ''Transvaal'']] under the command of [[John Fairbairn (naval officer)|John Fairbairn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sanap.ac.za&quot;/&gt; On 1 October 1948 the annexation was made official when [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]] [[Gideon Brand van Zyl]] signed the [[Prince Edward Islands Act, 1948]]. In terms of the Act, the islands fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Cape Town]] [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|Magistrate's Court]], and [[Law of South Africa|South African law]] as applied in the [[Western Cape]] applies on them. The islands are also deemed to be situated within the electoral district containing the [[Port of Cape Town]]; {{As of|2006|lc=on}} this is [[ward (politics)|ward]] 55 of the [[City of Cape Town]].

== Facilities ==

A new research base was built from 2001 to 2011 on Marion Island to replace older buildings on the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeld-1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Yeld, John |title=New Marion Island base opens |date=18 March 2011 |newspaper=The Cape Argus (Independent Newspapers) |url=http://www.iol.co.za/capeargus/new-marion-island-base-opens-1043782 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6gs92sCcx |archivedate=18 April 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The access to the station is either by boat or helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenroute.com/new-base-puts-sa-on-top-of-weather_article_op_view_id_6114 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20151125032642/http://www.gardenroute.com/new-base-puts-sa-on-top-of-weather_article_op_view_id_6114 |archivedate=25 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A helipad and storage hangar is located behind the main base structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeld-1&quot; /&gt;

== Amateur radio ==
{{As of|2014}}, Marion Island, prefix ZS8, was the third most wanted [[DXCC]] &quot;entity&quot; by the [[amateur radio]] community. By the end of 2014, it had dropped to 27th, after simultaneous activity by three licencees in the 2013/2014 team. However, their activity was mainly on voice. On Morse telegraphy, the Islands remain the second most wanted entity after North Korea, while on Data they are sixth out of 340.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.clublog.org/mostwanted.php |title=Club Log: DXCC Most-Wanted List for April 2016 |publisher=Secure.clublog.org |date=2016-04-23 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fiction ==

Prince Edward Island features as the setting for the climax of the maritime adventure story ''[[South Trap]]'' (AKA ''Southtrap'') by [[Geoffrey Jenkins]].

The Prince Edward Islands and particularly Marion Island feature prominently in the 1929 novel ''[[Mary of Marion Isle]]'' by [[H. Rider Haggard]].

[[Image:Map of Zanzibar Archipelago-en.svg|thumb|The Zanzibar Archipelago]]
The '''Zanzibar Archipelago''' consists of several islands lying off the coast of [[East Africa]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. There are four main islands, three primary islands with human populations, a fourth coral island that serves as an essential breeding ground for seabirds, plus a number of smaller islets that surround them and an isolated tiny islet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Overland |author=Lizzie Williams|year= 2005|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=1-77007-187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the archipelago belongs to the [[Zanzibar]] semi-autonomous region of [[Tanzania]], while [[Mafia Island]] and its associated islets fall under the suzerainty of the [[Pwani Region]] on the mainland.

The '''Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands''', also called '''Cocos Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|ə|s}}) and '''Keeling Islands''', is a [[States and territories of Australia|territory]] of Australia, located in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of [[Christmas Island]] and approximately midway between Australia and [[Sri Lanka]].

The territory consists of two [[atoll]]s and 27 [[coral island]]s, of which two, [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] and [[Home Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Home Island]], are inhabited with a total population of approximately 600.

== Geography ==

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands consist of two flat, low-lying coral atolls with an area of {{convert|14.2|km2|sqmi}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} of coastline, a highest elevation of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation. The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast [[trade winds]] for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. [[Tropical cyclone]]s may occur in the early months of the year.

'''[[North Keeling]] Island''' is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the lagoon, about {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide, on the east side. The island measures {{convert|1.1|km2|acre}} in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about {{convert|0.5|km2|acre}}. North Keeling Island and the surrounding sea to {{convert|1.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} from shore form the [[Pulu Keeling National Park]], established on 12 December 1995. It is home to the only surviving population of the endemic, and endangered, [[Cocos Buff-banded Rail]].

'''South Keeling Islands''' is an atoll consisting of 24 individual islets forming an incomplete atoll ring, with a total land area of {{convert|13.1|km2|sqmi}}. Only [[Home Island]] and [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] are populated. The Cocos Malays maintain weekend shacks, referred to as pondoks, on most of the larger islands.

There are no rivers or lakes on either atoll. Fresh water resources are limited to [[Lens (hydrology)|water lenses]] on the larger islands, underground accumulations of rainwater lying above the seawater. These lenses are accessed through shallow bores or wells.

===Flora and fauna===

==Demographics==
In 2010, the population of the islands is estimated at just over 600.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island (estimated population 100) and the ethnic [[Cocos Malays|Malays]] on Home Island (estimated population 500). A [[Cocos Islands Malay|Cocos dialect]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] and English are the main languages spoken, and 80% of Cocos Islanders are [[Sunni Muslim]], the other 20% are of another religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:AMH-5134-NA Compass chart of the Kokos islands.jpg|thumb|Historic compass chart of the Cocos islands&lt;ref[http://www.gahetna.nl/en/collectie/archief/inventaris/index/eadid/4.VEL/inventarisnr/338/level/file &gt;Nationaal Archief, The Hague, archive 4.VEL inventorynumber 338]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1609, Captain [[William Keeling]] was the first European to see the islands, while serving in the [[East India Company]],&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;&gt;[[Joshua Slocum]], &quot;[https://archive.org/stream/sailingalonearou00slocuoft#page/212/mode/2up Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, p. 212]&lt;/ref&gt; but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century.

In 1814, a Scottish merchant seaman named Captain [[John Clunies-Ross]] stopped briefly at the islands on a trip to India, nailing up a [[Union Jack]] and planning to return and settle on the islands with his family in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt;

However, a wealthy Englishman named [[Alexander Hare]] had similar plans, and hired a captain{{spaced ndash}} coincidentally, Clunies-Ross' brother{{spaced ndash}}to bring him and a [[harem]] of forty [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] women to the islands, where he hoped to set up his own private residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt; Hare had previously served as resident of  [[Banjarmasin]], a town in [[Borneo]], and found that &quot;he could not confine himself to the tame life that prosy civilisation affords&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt;

When Clunies-Ross returned two years later with his wife, children and mother-in-law, and found Hare already established on the island and living with a private harem, a feud grew instantly between the two men.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt; Clunies-Ross' eight sailors {{citation needed span|text=&quot;began at once the invasion of the new kingdom to take possession of it, women and all&quot;|date=April 2016}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ohwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293|title=Gleanings in Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some time, Hare's women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross' sailors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clunies-ross.com/ The Clunies-Ross Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; Disheartened, Hare left the island. He died in [[Bencoolen (city)|Bencoolen]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Post (London) 20 March 1835&lt;/ref&gt;

Clunies-Ross' workers were paid in a currency called the [[Cocos rupee]], a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6730047.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - From Our Own Correspondent - The man who lost a 'coral kingdom'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1836, {{HMS|Beagle}} under Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] arrived to take soundings to establish the profile of the atoll as part of the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey expedition of the ''Beagle'']]. To the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Keynes |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Keynes |year=2001 |title=Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=445 413–418] |accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's assistant [[Syms Covington]] noted that &quot;an Englishman [he was in fact Scottish] and HIS family, with about sixty or seventy [[mulatto]]s from the Cape of Good Hope, live on one of the islands. Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape.&quot;

===Annexation by the British Empire===
The islands were annexed by the British Empire in 1857. This annexation was carried out by [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)#Sons of Thomas Fremantle|Captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle]] in command of {{HMS|Juno|1844|6}}. Fremantle claimed the islands for the British Empire and appointed [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Ross II]] as Superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cocos Islands|journal=The Chambers's Journal|year=1899|volume= 76|pages=187–190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddUXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, their administration was placed under the [[Straits Settlements]], which included [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and Singapore. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the islands in perpetuity to the [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Clunies-Ross family]] in 1886. The Cocos Islands under the Clunies-Ross family have been cited as an example of a 19th-century [[micronation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1901 a telegraph cable station was established on Direction Island. Undersea cables went to [[Rodrigues]], [[Mauritius]], [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Java]] and [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]]. In 1910 a wireless station was established to communicate with passing ships. The cable station ceased operation in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cocoskeelingislands.com.au/home-2/history/money-22&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
{{main|Battle of Cocos}}
On the morning of 9 November 1914, the islands became the site of the [[Battle of Cocos]], one of the first naval battles of [[World War I]]. A landing party from the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}} captured and disabled the wireless and cable communications station on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]], but not before the station was able to transmit a distress call. An Allied troop convoy was passing nearby, and the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} was detached from the convoy escort to investigate.

''Sydney'' spotted the island and ''Emden'' at 09:15, with both ships preparing for combat.  At 11:20, the heavily damaged ''Emden'' beached herself on [[North Keeling Island]]. The Australian warship broke to pursue ''Emden''{{'}}s supporting [[Collier (ship)|collier]], which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, ''Emden''{{'}}s [[battle ensign]] was still flying: usually a sign that a ship intends to continue fighting. After no response to instructions to lower the ensign, two salvoes were shot into the beached cruiser, after which the Germans lowered the flag and raised a [[flag of surrender|white sheet]]. ''Sydney'' had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.

134 personnel aboard ''Emden'' were killed, and 69 were wounded, compared to only 4 killed and 16 wounded aboard ''Sydney''. The German survivors were taken aboard the Australian cruiser, which caught up to the troop convoy in [[Colombo]] on 15 November, then transported to [[Malta]] and handed over the prisoners to the [[British Army]]. An additional 50 German personnel from the shore party, unable to be recovered before ''Sydney'' arrived, commandeered a schooner and escaped from Direction Island, eventually arriving in [[Constantinople]]. ''Emden'' was the last active [[Central Powers]] warship in the Indian or Pacific Ocean, which meant troopships from Australia and New Zealand could sail without naval escort, and Allied ships could be deployed elsewhere.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the cable station was once again a vital link. The Cocos were valuable for direction finding by the [[Y service]], the world-wide intelligence system used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, S. 2012. ''The Secret Listeners''. Aurum Press Ltd. ISBN 978 1 78131 079 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied planners noted that the islands might be seized as an airfield for [[Nazi Germany|German]] planes and as a base for commerce raiders operating in the Indian Ocean.  Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s entry into the war, Japanese forces occupied neighbouring islands. To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands' garrison, the [[seaplane]] anchorage between Direction and [[Horsburgh Island|Horsburgh]] islands was not used. Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the [[Fall of Singapore]] in 1942, the islands were administered from [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), and West and Direction Islands were placed under [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military administration. The islands' garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army's [[King's African Rifles]], located on Horsburgh Island, with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made no attempt either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month.

On the night of 8–9 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the [[Ceylon Defence Force]], [[Mutiny|mutinied]] under the leadership of [[Gratien Fernando]]. The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers and were also supposedly inspired by [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] beliefs. They attempted to take control of the [[Artillery|gun battery]] on the islands. The [[Cocos Islands Mutiny]] was crushed, but the mutineers killed one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer. Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial that was later alleged to have been improperly conducted. Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando. These were to be the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=CIM&gt;{{cite book |last=Cruise |first=Noel |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Cocos Islands Mutiny |publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press |year=2002 |location=Fremantle |page=248 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=1-86368-310-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-166|I-166]]'' bombarded the islands but caused no damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm|title=Imperial Submarines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the [[Operation Tiderace|planned]] reinvasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and reconquest of Singapore. The first aircraft to arrive were [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk VIIIs of [[No. 136 Squadron RAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fail|first=J.E.H.|title=FORWARD STRATEGIC AIR BASE COCOS ISLAND|url=http://www.rquirk.com/cocos/cocosart.htm|work=www.rquirk.com|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They included some [[B-24|Liberator]] bombers from [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|No. 321 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF]] (members of exiled Dutch forces serving with the [[Royal Air Force]]), which were also stationed on the islands.  When in July 1945 [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99]] and [[No. 356 Squadron RAF|No. 356]] RAF squadrons arrived on West Island, they brought with them a daily newspaper called ''Atoll'' which contained news of what was happening in the outside world.  Run by airmen in their off-duty hours, it achieved fame when dropped by Liberator bombers on POW camps over the heads of the Japanese guards. In 1946, the administration of the islands reverted to [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] and it became part of the [[Colony of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Colony of Singapore. Government Gazette.

===Transfer to Australia===
On 23 November 1955, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the ''Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955'' (an Australian Act) pursuant to the ''Cocos Islands Act, 1955'' (a UK Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | title=Cocos (Keeling) Islands | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/jun/28/cocos-keeling-islands#S5CV0934P0-05978 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511190422/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/jun/28/cocos-keeling-islands | archivedate=11 May 2011 |house=House of Commons | date=28 June 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. H.&amp;nbsp;J. Hull was appointed the first Official Representative (now Administrator) of the new Territory. He had been a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Australian Navy and was released for the purpose. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, Mr. Hull's appointment was terminated and [[John William Stokes]] was appointed on secondment from the Northern Territory Police. A media release at the end of October 1958 by the Minister for Territories, Mr. Hasluck, commended Mr. Hull's three years of service on Cocos.

Stokes served in the position from 31 October 1958 to 30 September 1960. His son's boyhood memories and photos of the Islands have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Tony |title=Whatever Will Be, I'll See: Growing Up in the 1940s, 50s and 60s in the Northern Territory, Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory |year=2012 |publisher=Tony Stokes |isbn=9780646575643 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.&amp;nbsp;I. Buffett [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] from [[Norfolk Island]] succeeded him and served from 28 July 1960 to 30 June 1966, and later acted as Administrator back on Cocos and on Norfolk Island. In 1974, Ken Mullen wrote a small book&lt;ref&gt;Cocos Keeling, the islands time forgot (1974). Ken Mullen. published by Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney. 122 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; about his time with wife and son from 1964 to 1966 working at the Cable Station on Direction Island.

In the 1970s, the Australian government's dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of A$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983, the Australian government reneged on this agreement, and told [[John Clunies-Ross]] that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to Clunies-Ross's shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cabinet papers: The last King of Cocos loses his palace|url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cabinet-papers-the-last-king-of-cocos-loses-his-palace-20151217-glqb6m.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Clunies-Ross now lives in Perth, Western Australia. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos.

Extensive preparations were undertaken by the government of Australia to prepare the Cocos Malays to vote in their referendum of self-determination. Discussions began in 1982, with an aim of holding the referendum, under United Nations supervision, in mid-1983. Under guidelines developed by the UN Decolonization Committee, residents were to be offered three choices: full independence, free association, or integration with Australia. The latter was preferred by both the islanders and the Australian government. However, a change in government in Canberra following the March 1983 Australian elections delayed the vote by one year. While the Home Island Council stated a preference for a traditional communal consensus &quot;vote&quot;, the UN insisted on a secret ballot. [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands status referendum, 1984|The referendum]] was held on 6 April 1984, with all 261 eligible islanders participating, including the Clunies-Ross family: 229 voted for integration, 21 for Free Association, nine for independence, and two failed to indicate a preference.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Chen, &quot;Pacific Island Development Plan: Cocos (Keeling) Islands- The Political Evolution of a Small Island Territory in the Indian Ocean&quot; (1987): Mr Chen was Administrator, Cocos Islands, from December 1983 – November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years a series of disputes have occurred between the Muslim Coco Malay inhabitants and the non-Muslim population of the islands.[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/lost-in-transition/story-e6frg6z6-1225768109174]

The islands are administered from [[Canberra]] by the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=First Assistant Secretary, Territories Division |title=Territories of Australia |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/territories |publisher=Attorney-General's Department |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2008 |quote=The Federal Government, through the Attorney-General's Department administers Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay, and Norfolk Island as Territories. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080206093322/http://www.ag.gov.au:80/territories |archivedate=6 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (before 29 November 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTARS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | quote = As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the Federal Election on 29 November 2007, administrative responsibility for Territories has been transferred to the Attorney General's Department. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071216154140/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx |archivedate = 16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; administration was carried out by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Department of Transport and Regional Services]]), through a non-resident [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator]] appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]].

The current Administrator is [[Barry Haase]], who was appointed on 5 October 2014 and is also the Administrator of [[Christmas Island]]. These two Territories comprise Australia's Indian Ocean Territories. The Australian Government provides Commonwealth-level government services through the Christmas Island Administration and the [[Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AAO Sep 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.gov.au/parliamentary/docs/aao_20130918.pdf|date=18 September 2013|title=Commonwealth of Australia Administrative Arrangements Order made on 18 September 2013|publisher=Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the Federal Government's [[Territories Law Reform Act 1992]], which came into force on 1 July 1992, Western Australian laws are applied to the Cocos Islands, &quot;so far as they are capable of applying in the Territory.&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A04395|title=Territories Law Reform Act 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-application or partial application of such laws is at the discretion of the federal government. The Act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over the islands. The Cocos Islands remain constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is power delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian Government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government.

There also exists a unicameral [[Shire of Cocos|Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council]] with seven seats. A full term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years. Federally, Cocos (Keeling) Islanders form the electorate of [[Division of Lingiari|Lingiari]] with Christmas Island and outback Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the electoral division of Lingiari (NT)|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nt/lingiari.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Defence and law enforcement===
Defence is the responsibility of the [[Australian Defence Force]]. There are no active military installations or defence personnel on the islands. The Administrator may request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force if required. The 2016 Australian Defence White Paper stated that the airfield in the island would be upgraded to support the RAAF's P-8 MPAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defence.gov.au/whitepaper/Docs/2016-Defence-White-Paper.pdf |title=2016 Defence White Paper (para. 4.66)|website=defence.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian law enforcement and community policing is provided by the [[Australian Federal Police]]. The normal deployment to the island is one [[sergeant]] and one [[constable]]. These are augmented by two locally engaged Special Members who have police powers.

===Courts===
{{see also|Supreme Court of Cocos (Keeling) Island}}
Since 1992, court services have been provided by the [[Department of the Attorney General (Western Australia)|Western Australian Department of the Attorney-General]] under a service delivery arrangement with the Australian Government. Western Australian Court Services provide Magistrates Court, District Court, Supreme Court, Family Court, Children's Court, Coroner's Court and Registry for births, deaths and marriages and change of name services. Magistrates and judges from Western Australia convene a [[circuit court]] as required.

===Health care===
Home Island and West Island have medical clinics providing basic health services, but serious medical conditions and injuries cannot be treated on the island and patients are sent to Perth for treatment.

== Economy ==

There is a small and growing tourist industry focused on water-based or nature activities.

Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but most food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia or elsewhere.

The Cocos Islands Cooperative Society Ltd. employs construction workers, [[stevedore]]s, and lighterage worker operations. Tourism employs others. The unemployment rate was 6.7% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?RegionSummary&amp;region=90102&amp;dataset=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;geoconcept=REGION&amp;datasetASGS=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;datasetLGA=ABS_REGIONAL_LGA&amp;regionLGA=REGION&amp;regionASGS=REGION|title=Cocos (Keeling) Islands : Region Data Summary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic importance ==

The Cocos Islands are geostrategically important because of their proximity to Indian Ocean and [[South China Sea]] shipping lanes.&lt;ref name=wsws /&gt; The United States Armed Forces have planned to construct airbases on the Cocos Islands, capable of supporting drone-based espionage and surveillance over the South China Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;Whitlock, Craig, &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-expand-ties-with-australia-as-it-aims-to-shift-forces-closer-to-se-asia/2012/03/19/gIQAPSXlcS_story.html U.S., Australia to broaden military ties amid Pentagon pivot to SE Asia]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euronews]] described the plan as providing Australian support for increased American presence in Southeast Asia, but likely to upset Chinese officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;euro&quot;&gt;Grubel, James, &quot;[http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1459124-australia-open-to-us-spy-flights-from-indian-ocean-island/ Australia open to US spy flights from Indian Ocean].&quot;  [[Euronews]], 28 March 2012. {{wayback|url=http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1459124-australia-open-to-us-spy-flights-from-indian-ocean-island/ |date=20120527063046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Cogan has written for the [[World Socialist Web Site]] that airbase construction at Cocos is one component of Obama's &quot;pivot&quot; towards Asia, facilitating control of the sea lanes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans and potentially allowing US forces to enforce a blockade against China.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;&gt;Cogan, James, &quot;[http://wsws.org/articles/2012/apr2012/darw-a14.shtml US Marines begin operations in northern Australia].&quot; ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'', 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After plans to construct airbases were leaked to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the then Australian defence minister [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]] stated that the Australian government views &quot;Cocos as being potentially a long-term strategic location, but that is down the track.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;&gt;McGuirk, Rod, &quot;[http://www.startribune.com/world/144482165.html Australia to Welcome 250 US Marines next Month, Plays down Proposal for Indian Ocean Air Base].&quot; {{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''[[Associated Press]]'', 27 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communications and transport ==

===Transport===
The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have fifteen kilometres of [[highway]].

There is one paved airport on the West Island. A tourist bus operates on Home Island.

The only airport is [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport]] with a single {{convert|2441|m|ft|abbr=on}} paved runway. [[Virgin Australia]] operates scheduled jet services from [[Perth Airport]] via Christmas Island. After 1952, the airport at Cocos Islands was a stop for airline flights between Australia and South Africa, and [[Qantas]] and [[South African Airways]] stopped there to refuel. The arrival of long range jet aircraft ended this need in 1967.

An interisland ferry, the ''Cahaya Baru'', connects West, Home and Direction Islands.

There is a [[lagoon]] anchorage between Horsburgh and Direction islands for larger vessels, while yachts have a dedicated anchorage area in the southern lee of Direction Island. There are no major [[seaport]]s on the islands.

===Communications===
The islands are connected within Australia's telecommunication system (with number range +61 8 9162 xxxx). Public phones are located on both West Island and Home Island. A reasonably reliable GSM mobile phone network (number range +61 406 xxx), run by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), operates on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.  SIM cards (full size) and recharge cards can be purchased from the Telecentre on West Island to access this service.

[[Australia Post]] provides mail services with the postcode 6799. There are post offices on West Island and Home Island. Standard letters and express post items are sent by air twice weekly, but all other mail is sent by sea and can take up to two months for delivery.

===Internet===
[[.cc]] is the Internet country code top-level domain ([[ccTLD]]) for Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is administered by VeriSign through a subsidiary company eNIC, which promotes it for international registration as &quot;the next .com&quot;; .cc was originally assigned in October 1997 to eNIC Corporation of Seattle WA by the IANA.  The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] also uses the .cc domain, along with .nc.tr.

Internet access on Cocos is provided by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), and is supplied via satellite ground station on West Island, and distributed via a wireless PPPoE-based WAN on both inhabited islands.  Casual internet access is available at the Telecentre on West Island, and the Indian Ocean Group Training office on Home Island.

The [[National Broadband Network]] announced in early 2012 that it would extend service to Cocos in 2015 via high speed satellite link.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo&quot;&gt;Kidman, Alex, &quot;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/nbn-to-launch-satellites-in-2015/ NBN To Launch Satellites in 2015].&quot; ''[[Gizmodo]]'', 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have access to a range of modern communication services. Digital television stations are broadcast from Western Australia via satellite. A local radio station, 6CKI – Voice of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, is staffed by community volunteers and provides some local content.

====Malaysian====
From 2013 onwards, Cocos Island will receive four Malaysian channels via satellite: [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]], [[ntv7]], [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]] and [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]].

'''Socotra''' ({{lang-ar|سُقُطْرَى}} ''{{transl|ar|Suquṭra}}''), also spelled '''Soqotra''', is an island and a small [[archipelago]] of four islands in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Socotra is part of [[Yemen]]. It had long been a part of the [[Aden Governorate]]. In 2004 it became attached to the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]], which is much closer to the island than Aden (although the nearest governorate was the [[Al Mahrah Governorate]]). In 2013, the archipelago became [[Soqatra Governorate|its own governorate]].

The island of Socotra is about 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies some {{convert|240|km|mi}} east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and {{convert|380|km|mi}} south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.youth.cn/yculture/200911/t20091118_1085530.htm|work=en.youth.cn|publisher=China Youth International|title=Socotra islands scenery in Yemen|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is very isolated and a third of its [[plant life]] is found nowhere else on the planet. It has been described as &quot;the most alien-looking place on Earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntingford&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Huntingford |first=George Wynn Brereton |title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea |publisher=Hakluyt Society |year=1980 |page=103 |isbn=0-904180-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island measures {{convert|132|km|mi}} in length and {{convert|49.7|km|mi}} in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/09/most-alien-looking-place-on-earth.html|date=4 September 2008|work=Dark Roasted Blend|title=The Most Alien-Looking Place on Earth|first=Avi|last=Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the notes to his translation of the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] remarks that the name Suqotra is not [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] in origin, but from the [[Sanskrit]] ''{{lang|sa-Latn|dvīpa}}'' (&quot;island&quot;) ''{{lang|sa-Latn|sukhadhara}}'' (&quot;supporting, or providing bliss&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntingford&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Huntingford |first=George Wynn Brereton |title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea |publisher=Hakluyt Society |year=1980 |page=103 |isbn=0-904180-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited origin of the name is the Arabic ''{{lang|ar-Latn|suq}}'' meaning &quot;market&quot; and ''{{lang|ar-Latn|qotra}}'' meaning &quot;dripping [[frankincense]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socotraislandadventure.com/Socotra_History.htm |publisher=DBT Socotra Adventure Tour |title=Socotra history }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

There was initially an [[Oldowan]] culture in Socotra. Oldowan stone tools were found in the area around [[Hadibo]] by V.A. Zhukov, a member of the Russian Complex Expedition in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Amirkhanov|first=K.A. |last2=Zhukov|first2=V.A.|last3=Naumkin|first3=V.V.|last4=Sedov|first4=A.V.|script-title=ru:Эпоха олдована открыта на острове Сокотра|journal=Pripoda|issue=7|year=2009|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihae.ru/konfer/simpozium.htm|title=Международньій Симлозиум &quot;Древнейшие Миграции Человека В Евразии&quot; Махачкала, 6 – 12 сентября 2009 года|last=Davuov|first=O.

A recent discovery of texts in several languages, including a wooden tablet in [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrene]] dated to the 3rd century AD, indicate the diverse origins of those who used Socotra as a trading base in antiquity.&lt;ref name=Sidebotham&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sidebotham| first = Steven E. | title = Berenike and the Ancient Maritime Spice Route | publisher = California | year = 2011 | page = 189 | isbn = 978-0-520-24430-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 a group of Belgian [[speleologists]] of the Socotra Karst Project investigated a cave on the island Socotra.   There, they came across a large number of inscriptions, drawings and archaeological objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=French|title=La grotte sanctuaire de Suqutra|url=http://www.archeologia-magazine.com/numero-396/l-alimentation-cyclades.1623.php|journal= Archéologia|issue=396|date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=French|last=Robin|first=C. |last2= Gorea|first2= M. |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_2002_num_146_2_22441 |title=Les vestiges antiques de la grotte de Hôq (Suqutra, Yémen) (note d'information)|journal= Comptesrendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|volume= 146|issue= 2|year=2002|pages=409–445|doi=10.3406/crai.2002.22441}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further investigation showed that these had been left by sailors who visited the island between the 1st century BC and the 6th century AD. Most of the texts are written in the Indian [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī script]], but there are also inscriptions in [[South Arabian script|South-Arabian]], [[Ge'ez script|Ethiopian]], Greek, [[Palmyrene script|Palmyrene]] and Bactrian scripts and languages. This corpus of nearly 250 texts and drawings thus constitutes one of the main sources for the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in that time period.&lt;ref name=strauch&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign Sailors on Socotra.

A local tradition holds that the inhabitants were converted to [[Christianity]] by [[Thomas the Apostle]] in AD 52. In the 10th century, the [[Arab]] [[geographer]] [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] stated that in his time most of the inhabitants were Christians. Socotra is also mentioned in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]''; Marco Polo did not pass anywhere near the island but recorded a report that &quot;the inhabitants are baptised Christians and have an 'archbishop'&quot; who, it is further explained, &quot;has nothing to do with the Pope in Rome, but is subject to an archbishop who lives at Baghdad.&quot; They were [[Nestorian Church|Nestorians]] but also practised ancient magic rituals despite the warnings of their archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polo|first= Marco|title=The Travels of Marco Polo|others=Translated and introduction by Ronald Latham|publisher= Penguin Books|year=1958|pages=296–297| isbn =0-14-044057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1737, Captain de la Garde-Jazier, commander of a French naval expedition to [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], was surprised to find Christian tribes living in the interior of Socotra during a five-week stopover on the island. He reported in a letter home that the tribesmen, &quot;due to lack of missionaries, had only retained a faint knowledge of Christianity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The goal of the 4-ship expedition, which sailed from Pondicherry (French India), was to force the ruler of Mocha to stop harassing French traders and abide by the provisions of a treaty of commerce signed with France 25 years earlier. While at Socotra, the troops practiced landing on beaches with their crafts. Henri Labrousse, ''Récits de la mer Rouge et de l'océan Indien'', Economica, Paris, 1992, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1507, a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fleet commanded by [[Tristão da Cunha]] with [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] landed at the then capital of Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to [[India]], and to liberate the presumed friendly Christians from Islamic rule. [[Tomás Fernandes]] started to build a fortress at Suq, the ''Forte de São Miguel de Socotorá''. However, the infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison. Moreover, the lack of a proper harbour for wintering led to the loss of many moored Portuguese ships, the most important of which was the ''Santo António'' [[galleon]] under the command of captain Manuel Pais da Veiga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monteiro|first= Alexandre|title=Uma página dos Descobrimentos: a ilha de Socotorá no século XVI|language=Portuguese|journal= National Geographic Portugal|date=June 2012|pages= 42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Portuguese abandoned the island four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415–1580|first=Bailey Wallys|last=Diffie|first2=George Davison |last2=Winius|page=233|year=1977|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-0782-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with Great Britain===

In 1834, the [[East India Company]], in the expectation that the Mahra sultan of Qishn and Socotra, who resided at Qishn on the mainland, would accept an offer to sell the island, stationed a garrison on Socotra. However, faced with the unexpected firm refusal of the sultan to sell, as well as the lack of good anchorages for a coaling station to be used by the new steamship line being put into service on the Suez-Bombay route, the British left in 1835. After the capture of Aden in 1839, the British lost all interest in acquiring Socotra. 

In January 1876, in exchange for a payment of 3000 thalers and a yearly subsidy, the sultan pledged &quot;himself, his heirs and successors, never to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the Island of Socotra or any of its dependencies.&quot; Additionally, he pledged to give assistance to any vessel, British or otherwise, that wrecked on the island and protect the crew, the passengers and the cargo, in exchange of a suitable reward.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sunnuds related to India and Neighbouring Countries'', Calcutta, 1876, volume VII, page 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1886, the British government, concerned about reports that the German navy had been visiting various ports in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean for the purpose of securing a naval base, decided to conclude a protectorate treaty with the sultan in which he promised this time to &quot;refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government&quot;, and give immediate notice to the British Resident at Aden of any attempt by another power to interfere with Socotra and its dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sunnuds related to India and Neighbouring Countries'', Calcutta, 1909, volume VIII, page 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from those obligations, this preemptive protectorate treaty, designed above all to seal off Socotra from competing colonial powers, left the sultan in control of the island. In 1897, the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] ship ''Aden'' sank after being wrecked on a reef near Socotra, with the loss of 78 lives. As some of the cargo had been plundered by islanders, the sultan was reminded of his obligations under the agreement of 1876.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sunnuds related to India and Neighbouring Countries'', Calcutta, 1909, volume VIII, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1967, in the wake of the departure of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate as well as the other states of the former Aden Protectorate were abolished. On 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of [[South Yemen]]. Since [[Yemeni unification]] in 1990, it has been part of the [[Republic of Yemen]].

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Socotra Cave 06.JPG|left|300px|thumb|Halah Cave (كهف حالة) east of the island. [[Stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s show how high it can reach compared to the {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} man with the torch. It is several hundred metres deep, with total darkness.]]
Socotra is one of the most-isolated landforms on Earth of [[continent]]al origin (i.e. not of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin). The archipelago was once part of the [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] and detached during the [[Miocene]] epoch, in the same set of [[rift (geology)|rift]]ing events that opened the [[Gulf of Aden]] to its northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aemnp.eu/PDF/52_s2/52_S2_1.pdf|title=Socotra Archipelago – a lifeboat in the sea of changes: advancement in Socotran insect biodiversity survey|journal=Acta Entomologica Musei Nationalis Pragae|format=PDF|volume=52|issue=supplementum 2|pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelago consists of the main island of Socotra ({{convert|3665|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}), the three smaller islands of [[Abd al Kuri]], [[Samhah]] and [[Darsa]], as well as small rock outcrops like Ka'l Fir'awn and Sābūnīyah that are uninhabitable by humans but important for [[seabird]]s.&lt;ref name=GEF&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shobrak |first1=Mohammed |last2=Alsuhaibany |first2=Abdullah |last3=Al-Sagheir |first3=Omer |others=Photographs by Abdullah Alsuhaibany |date=November 2003 |title=Status of Breeding Seabirds in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden |work=PERSGA Technical Series |issue=8 |publisher=Regional Organization for Conservation of Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA) |location=Jeddah, Saudia Arabia |format=PDF |language=English, Arabic |url=http://www.persga.org/Files//Publications/Technical/TS/TS8_Status_of_Breeding_Seabirds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main island has three geographical terrains: the narrow coastal [[plain]]s, a [[limestone]] [[plateau]] permeated with [[karst]]ic caves, and the Haghier Mountains.&lt;ref name = Flora&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socotraislandadventure.com/Socotra_%20fauna&amp;flora.htm|title = Socotra Fauna and Flora}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains rise to {{convert|1503|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=11317 |title= Socotra High Point, Yemen |publisher= Peakbagger.com |accessdate =8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is about {{convert|125|km|mi}} long and {{convert|45|km|mi}} north to south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.socotraislandadventure.com/Socotra_%20fauna&amp;flora.htm |title= Natural History |publisher= DBT Socotra Adventure Tour |accessdate =8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Socotra is classified in the [[Köppen climate classification]] as ''BWh'' and ''BSh'', meaning a [[tropical climate|tropical]] [[desert climate]] and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-desert climate]] with a mean annual temperature over {{convert|25|°C|°F|disp=or}}. Yearly rainfall is light, but is fairly spread throughout the year. Due to [[orographic lift]] provided by the interior mountains, especially during the northeast monsoon from October to December, the highest inland areas can average as much as {{convert|800|mm|in|2}} per year and receive over {{convert|250|mm|in|2}} per month in November or December.&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, Paul, and , De Geest, Peter; ‘The climate of Socotra Island (Yemen): A first-time assessment of the timing of the monsoon wind reversal and its influence on precipitation and vegetation patterns’; ''Journal of Arid Environments'', vol. 74, issue 11 (November 2010); pp. 1507-1515&lt;/ref&gt; The southwest [[monsoon]] season from July to September brings strong winds and high seas. For many centuries, the sailors of Gujarat called the maritime route near Socotra as “Sikotro Sinh”, meaning the lion of Socotra, that constantly roars—referring to the high seas near Socotra.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In an extremely unusual occurrence, the western side of Socotra received more than {{convert|410|mm|in|2}} of rain from [[Cyclone Chapala]] in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The mediocre model forecasts of Cyclone Chapala’s rainfall over Yemen  |first= Angela |last= Fritz |date= 5 November 2015 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/11/05/the-mediocre-model-forecasts-of-cyclone-chapalas-rainfall-over-yemen/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name = Reuters&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL23671476 FACTBOX-Socotra, jewel of biodiversity in Arabian Sea]. Reuters, 2008-04-23&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, a team of [[United Nations]] biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. They counted nearly 700 [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, found nowhere else on earth; only [[Hawaii]], [[New Caledonia]], and the [[Galápagos Islands]] have more impressive numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdick2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/travel/tmagazine/03well.socotra.t.html|title=The Wonder Land of Socotra|last=Burdick|first=Alan|date=25 March 2007|work=T Magazine|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=9 November 2009|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long geological isolation of the Socotra archipelago and its fierce heat and drought have combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora. Botanical field surveys led by the [[Centre for Middle Eastern Plants]] (part of the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]) indicate that 307 out of the 825 (37%) plant species on Socotra are endemic, i.e., they are found nowhere else on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, A.G. 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=A.G. |last2= Morris|first2=M.|year=2004|title=Ethnoflora of the Socotra Archipelago|publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire flora of the Socotra Archipelago has been assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]], with 3 Critically Endangered and 27 Endangered plant species recognised in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, A.G. 2004&quot;/&gt;

One of the most striking of Socotra's plants is the [[Dracaena cinnabari|dragon's blood]] tree (''Dracaena cinnabari''), which is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap was thought to be the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, A.G. 2004&quot;/&gt; Also important in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic [[aloe]]s, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree ''[[Dorstenia gigas]]'', the cucumber tree ''[[Dendrosicyos socotranus]]'', the rare Socotran pomegranate (''[[Punica protopunica]]''), ''[[Aloe perryi]]'', and ''[[Boswellia socotrana]]''.&lt;ref name=Kingdon&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kingdon | first = Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Kingdon | title = Island Africa: The Evolution of Africa's Rare Plants and Animals | location = Princeton, New Jersey | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6_VqQgAACAAJ |publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1989 | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-691-08560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island group also has a rich fauna, including several endemic species of [[bird]]s, such as the [[Socotra starling]] (''Onychognathus frater''), the [[Socotra sunbird]] (''Nectarinia balfouri''), [[Socotra bunting]] (''Emberiza socotrana''), [[Socotra cisticola]] (''Cisticola haesitatus''), [[Socotra sparrow]] (''Passer insularis''), [[Socotra golden-winged grosbeak]] (''Rhynchostruthus socotranus''), and a species in a monotypic genus, the [[Socotra warbler]] (''Incana incana'').&lt;ref name=Kingdon/&gt; Many of the bird species are endangered by predation by non-native [[feral cat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdick2007&quot; /&gt; While there are no native amphibians, the reptiles species are over 90 percent endemic to Socotra and include skinks, legless lizards, and one species of [[chameleon]], ''[[Chamaeleo monachus]]''.

As with many isolated island systems, [[bat]]s are the only [[mammal]]s native to Socotra. In contrast, the [[coral reef]]s of Socotra are diverse, with many endemic species.&lt;ref name=Kingdon/&gt;  Socotra is also one of the homes of the butterfly ''[[Bicyclus anynana]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bicyclus, Site of Markku Savela&lt;/ref&gt;

Over two thousand years of human settlement on the islands have slowly but continuously changed the environment, and according to [[Jonathan Kingdon]], &quot;the animals and plants that remain represent a degraded fraction of what once existed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kingdon /&gt; The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] says the island had crocodiles and large lizards, and the present reptilian fauna appears to be greatly reduced. Until a few centuries ago, there were rivers and wetlands on the island, greater stocks of the endemic trees, and abundant pasture. The Portuguese recorded the presence of [[water buffalo]]es in the early 17th century. Now there are only sand gullies, and many native plants only survive where there is greater moisture or protection from livestock.&lt;ref name=Kingdon/&gt; The remaining Socotra fauna is greatly threatened by [[goat]]s and other introduced species.

===UNESCO recognition===
The island was recognised by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) as a world natural heritage site in July 2008. The [[European Union]] has supported such a move, calling on both UNESCO and International Organisation of Protecting Environment to classify the island archipelago among the environmental heritages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabanews.net/en/news151852.htm|title= EU to protect Socotra archipelago environment|publisher=Yemen News Agency (SABA)|work=Saba Net|date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Most of the inhabitants are indigenous Soqotri people from [[Al-Mahrah tribe|Al-Mahrah]] tribe, who are of Southern Arabian descent from [[Al Mahrah Governorate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Xavier&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Georg|last= Schurhammer|title=Francis Xavier; His Life, His Times: India, 1541–1544|volume= 2|publisher=Jesuit Historical Institute|year=1982|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are said to be especially closely related with the [[Qara people|Qara]] and [[Mehri people|Mahra]] groups of Southern [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Natvoltn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|editor-first= Norman|editor-last= Lockyer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA575|journal= Nature|volume= 29|year= 1884|pages=575–576|title=Socotra|doi= 10.1038/029575b0|issue= 755}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a small number of residents of [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[India]]n origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xavier&quot;/&gt; In addition, the island is inhabited by various [[Black people|Black African]] peoples, who are believed to be descendants of runaway slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natvoltn&quot;/&gt;

The Semitic language [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]], spoken originally only in Socotra by Al-Mahrah people, is related to such other [[Modern South Arabian]] languages on the Arabian mainland as [[Mehri language|Mehri]], [[Harsusi language|Harsusi]], [[Bathari language|Bathari]], [[Shehri language|Shehri]], and [[Hobyot language|Hobyot]]. Soqotri is also spoken by Al-Mahrah minority populations in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]].

The majority of male residents on Socotra are reported to be in the J* subclade of [[Haplogroup J-P209|Y-DNA haplogroup J]]. Several of the female lineages on the island, notably those in [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|mtDNA haplogroup N]], are found nowhere else on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Černý|first1=Viktor|last2=Pereira|first2=Luísa|last3=Kujanová|first3=Martina|last4=Vašíková|first4=Alžběta|last5=Hájek|first5=Martin|last6=Morris|first6=Miranda|last7=Mulligan|first7=Connie J.|title=Out of Arabia—The settlement of Island Soqotra as revealed by mitochondrial and Y chromosome genetic diversity|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=April 2009|volume=138|issue=4|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20960|pmid=19012329|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Connie_Mulligan/publication/23476615_Out_of_Arabia-The_settlement_of_Island_Soqotra_as_revealed_by_mitochondrial_and_Y_chromosome_genetic_diversity/links/5653185908aefe619b18f505.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all inhabitants of Socotra, numbering nearly 50,000, live on the homonymous main island of the archipelago.&lt;ref name = Reuters/&gt; The principal city, [[Hadibu]] (with a population of 8,545 at the [[census]] of 2004); the second largest town, [[Qalansiyah]] (population 3,862); and [[Qād̨ub]] (population 929) are all located on the north coast of the island of Socotra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso-yemen.org/content.php?lng=english&amp;id=293|work=The General Population Housing and Establishment Census2004|title= Final Census Results2004: The General Frame of the Population Final Results (First Report)|publisher=Central Statistical Organisation|date=6 January 2007|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 450 people live on 'Abd-al-Kūrī and 100 on Samha; the island of Darsa and the [[islet]]s of the archipelago are uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socotraproject.org/index.php?page=content&amp;id=7&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelago forms two [[Districts of Yemen|districts]] of the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]]:
* the district of Hadibu (حديبو), with a population of 32,285 and a district seat at Hadibu, consists of the eastern two-thirds of the main island of Socotra;
* the district of Qulansiyah wa 'Abd-al-Kūrī (قلنسيه وعبد الكوري), with a population of 10,557 and a district seat at Qulansiyah, consists of the minor islands (the island of 'Abd-al-Kūrī chief among them) and the western third of the main island.

=== Religion ===
The islanders followed [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]] until 52 AD, when, according to local beliefs, Thomas the Apostle was shipwrecked there on his way to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Socotra history :: Socotra Eco-Tours|url = http://www.socotra-eco-tours.com/products/socotra-history/|website = www.socotra-eco-tours.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then supposedly constructed a church out of his ship's wreckage and baptized many Socotrans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; After this, Christianity became the main religion of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; They followed [[Nestorius]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Constantinople]] who was later [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for [[Nestorianism|heresies]]. The Socotrans remained loyal to his teachings and joined the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; During the 900s, Arab [[geographer]] [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] recorded during his visits that most of the islanders were Christian. Explorer Marco Polo wrote in his travelogue:&lt;blockquote&gt;“I give you my word that the people of this island are the most expert enchanters in the world. It is true that the archbishop does not approve of these enchantments and rebukes them for the practice. But this has no effect, because they say that their forefathers did these things of old.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = The history of Socotra|url = http://www.socotraislandadventure.com/Socotra_History.htm|website = www.socotraislandadventure.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Christianity in Socotra went into decline when the [[Mahra Sultanate|Mahra sultanate]] took power in the 1500s and became mostly Muslim by the time the Portuguese arrived later that century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; An 1884 edition of [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a science journal, writes that the disappearance of Christian [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[monument]]s can be accounted for by a [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] excursion to the island in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qVEEAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Nature Publishing Group|date = 1884-01-01|first = Sir Norman|last = Lockyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the only remnants of Christianity are some cross engravings from the 1st century AD, a few Christian tombs, and some church ruins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socotra-eco-tours.com/products/socotra-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The primary occupations of the people of Socotra have traditionally been fishing, [[animal husbandry]], and the cultivation of [[date palm|dates]].

Monsoons long made the archipelago inaccessible from June to September each year. However, in July 1999, a new airport opened Socotra to the outside world all year round. There is regular service to and from [[Aden]] and [[Sana'a]]. All scheduled commercial flights make a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] at [[Riyan Airport|Riyan-Mukalla Airport]] ([[ICAO]] code &quot;OYRN&quot;). [[Socotra Airport]] (&quot;OYSQ&quot;) is located about 12&amp;nbsp;km (8&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the main city, Hadibu, and close to the third largest town in the archipelago, Qād̨ub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adds.aviationweather.gov/metars/stations.txt aviationweather.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diesel generator]]s make electricity widely available in Socotra. A paved road runs along the north shore from Qulansiyah to Hadibu and then to the DiHamri area; and another paved road, from the northern coast to the southern through the Dixsam Plateau.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The former capital is located to the east of Hadibu. A small [[Yemen Army|Yemeni Army]] barracks lies at the western end of Hadibu, and the former President of Yemen, [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], has a residence there.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Some residents raise cattle and goats. The chief export products of the island are [[date palm|dates]], [[ghee]], [[tobacco]], and [[fish]].

At the end of the 1990s, a [[United Nations Development Program]] was launched with the aim of providing a close survey of the island of Socotra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socotraproject.org/index.php?page=content&amp;id=32 socotraproject.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The project called Socotra Governance and Biodiversity Project have listed following goals from 2009:
* Local governance support
* Development and implementation of mainstreaming tools
* Strengthening [[nongovernmental organization]]s' advocacy
* Direction of biodiversity conservation benefits to the local people
* Support to the fisheries sector and training of professionals

In February 2014, the ''[[Economist magazine]]'' reported that Socotra was being considered as a possible site for the [[Yemeni jihadist rehabilitation program]].&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;
{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21595506-could-guant-namos-biggest-bunch-prisoners-be-sent-socotra-island |title= Could Guantánamo’s biggest bunch of prisoners be sent to Socotra? |publisher= [[Economist magazine]] |date= 2014-02-01 |location= [[Hadibu, Socotra]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140131022349/http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21595506-could-guant-namos-biggest-bunch-prisoners-be-sent-socotra-island |archivedate= 2014-01-31 |accessdate= 2014-02-03 |deadurl= No  |quote= In November a Yemeni newspaper, el-Ule, ran a story about a “new Guantánamo” to be set up on Socotra; a cartoon mixed the island’s dragon-blood tree (pictured above) with the Guantánamo inmates’ orange uniform.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Public transport on Socotra is limited to a few minibuses; car hire usually means hiring a 4WD car with driver.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socotraproject.org/index.php?page=content&amp;id=22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1998879,00.html|title= Socotra: The Other Galápagos Awaits Tourists|first=Oliver|last=Holmes|date=23 June 2010|journal=Time|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport is a delicate matter on Socotra because, as much as modern transportation has its advantages, road construction has been considered detrimental to the island and its ecosystem. The most harm is being done by chemical pollution from road construction and road provoked habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Socotra eco impact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lisa|first1=Banfield|title=Past and present human impacts on the biodiversity of  Socotra Island - Paper|url=http://www.friendsofsoqotra.org/Bibliography/pdfs/Van%20Damme%20&amp;%20Banfield%202011%20Socotra%20Conservation.pdf|website=http://www.friendsofsoqotra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more eco-friendly alternatives, companies have started offering bicycle&lt;ref name=&quot;tovisitsocotra.com bike tours&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Socotra tours|url=http://www.tovisitsocotra.com/Other_activities.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enduro motorcycle tours&lt;ref name=&quot;Alive Expedition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alive|first1=Expedition|title=Enduro motorcycles expedition to alien planet |url=http://alive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Socotra

The only port on Socotra is 5&amp;nbsp;km (3&amp;nbsp;mi) east of [[Hadibu]].  Ships connect the port with the Yemeni coastal city of [[Al Mukalla]]. According to information from the ports, the journey takes 2–3 days and the service is used mostly for cargo.

[[Yemenia]] and [[Felix Airways]] flew from [[Socotra Airport]] to [[Sana'a]] and [[Aden]] via [[Riyan Airport]]. As of March 2015, due to [[Yemeni Civil War (2015)|ongoing civil war]] involving Saudi Arabia's  Air Force all flights to and from Socotra have been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghattas|first1=Abir|title=Yemen's No Fly Zone: Thousands of Yemenis are Stranded Abroad|url=https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/03/31/yemens-no-fly-zone-thousands-of-yemenis-are-stranded-abroad/#|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alphonse Group''' belong to the [[Outer Islands (Seychelles)|Outer Islands]] of the [[Seychelles]], lying in the southwest of the island nation, {{convert|403|km|mi|abbr=off}} southwest the capital, [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]] Island. The closest island is [[Desnœufs Island]] of the [[Amirante Islands]], {{convert|87|km|0|abbr=on}} further north.

==Islands in the Alphonse Group==
The Alphonse Group consists of two atolls that are only {{convert|2|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} apart, separated by a deep channel:
#[[Alphonse Atoll]] in the north, with only one island, Alphonse Island
#[[St. François Atoll]] in the south, with the islands St. François and Bijoutier

Only Alphonse Island is inhabited. The aggregate land area of all three islets in both atolls is than {{convert|2.21|km2|0|abbr=on}}, but the total area including reefs and lagoons amounts to roughly {{convert|65|km2|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seychelles.travel/en/about_seychelles/island.php?rc=1&amp;aid=57 The Islands of the Seychelles]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seychelles''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Seychelles.ogg|s|eɪ|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|l|z}} {{respell|say|SHELZ|'}}; French: {{IPA-fr|sɛʃɛl|}}), officially the '''Republic of Seychelles''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|République des Seychelles}}; [[Seychellois Creole|Creole]]: ''Repiblik Sesel''), is an [[archipelago]] and country in the Indian Ocean. The 115-[[island country]], whose capital is [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], lies {{convert|1500|km|mi|0}} east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include [[Comoros]], [[Mayotte]], [[Madagascar]], [[Réunion]] and [[Mauritius]] to the south.

Seychelles, with a population of roughly 93,000, has the [[List of African countries by population|smallest population of any independent African state]]; however, it does have a larger population than the British overseas territory [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goafrica.about.com/od/africatraveltips/a/africafacts.htm |title=Facts about Africa|author=Anouk Zijlma |publisher=Goafrica.about.com |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of Seychelles}}
[[File:Victoria Seychelles 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria Seychelles 1900s]]
The Seychelles were uninhabited throughout most of recorded history. Some scholars assume that [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] seafarers and later [[Maldive Islands|Maldivian]] and Arab traders were the first to visit the uninhabited Seychelles.  The earliest recorded sighting by Europeans took place in 1502 by the Portuguese Admiral [[Vasco da Gama]], who passed through the [[Amirantes]] and named them after himself (islands of the Admiral). The earliest recorded landing was in January 1609, by the crew of the &quot;Ascension&quot; under Captain Sharpeigh during the fourth voyage of the British [[East India Company]].

A transit point for trade between Africa and Asia, the islands were occasionally used by pirates until the French began to take control starting in 1756 when a Stone of Possession was laid by Captain Nicholas Morphey. The islands were named after [[Jean Moreau de Séchelles]], [[Louis XV]]'s Minister of Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Assembly of Seychelles |title=Our History |url=http://www.nationalassembly.sc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=53| accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British controlled the islands between 1794 and 1810. Jean Baptiste Quéau de Quincy, French administrator of Seychelles during the years of war with the United Kingdom, declined to resist when armed enemy warships arrived. Instead, he successfully negotiated the status of capitulation to Britain which gave the settlers a privileged position of neutrality.

Britain eventually assumed full control upon the surrender of [[Mauritius]] in 1810, formalised in 1814 at the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]]. Seychelles became a [[crown colony]] separate from Mauritius in 1903. Elections were held in 1966 and 1970.

=== Independence (1976) ===
Independence was granted in 1976 as a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Seychelles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seychelles.com/en/about_seychelles/history.php |title=History of Seychelles|publisher=seychelles.com |year=2009 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s Seychelles was &quot;the place to be seen, a playground for film stars and the international jet set&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;Joanna Symons (21 March 2005).

''Telegraph.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, a [[coup d'état]] by [[France Albert René]] ousted the first president of the republic, [[James Mancham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;africanhistory.about.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/seychelles/p/SeychellesHist1.htm |title=africanhistory.about.com |publisher=africanhistory.about.com |date= |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; René discouraged over-dependence on tourism and declared that he wanted &quot;to keep the Seychelles for the Seychellois&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The 1979 constitution declared a socialist one-party state, which lasted until 1991.

In the 1980s there were a series of coup attempts against President [[France-Albert René]], some of which were supported by South Africa. In 1981, [[Mike Hoare]] led a team of 43 South African mercenaries masquerading as holidaying Rugby players in a coup attempt in what is known as the [[Mike_Hoare#Seychelles_affair_and_subsequent_conviction|Seychelles affair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; There was a gun battle at the airport, and most of the mercenaries later escaped in a hijacked [[Air India]] plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;The leader of this hijacking was the infamous German mercenary D. Clodo, a former member of the Rhodesian SAS.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Mike The Seychelles Affair (Transworld, London, 1986; ISBN 0-593-01122-8)&lt;/ref&gt; Clodo later stood trial in South Africa (where he was aquitted) as well as in his home country Germany for air-piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bartus László: Maffiaregény ISBN: 9634405967,Budapest 2001 &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, an attempted coup led by the Seychelles Minister of Defence, Ogilvy Berlouis, caused President René to request assistance from India. In [[Operation Flowers are Blooming]], the Indian naval vessel [[INS Vindhyagiri]] arrived in Port Victoria to help avert the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Brewster and Ranjit Rai|url=https://www.academia.edu/7698363/Flowers_Are_Blooming_the_story_of_the_India_Navys_secret_operation_in_the_Seychelles|title=Flowers Are Blooming: the story of the India Navy's secret operation in the Seychelles. Retrieved 10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft of a new constitution failed to receive the requisite 60% of voters in 1992, but an amended version was approved in 1993.

In January 2013, Seychelles declared a state of emergency; the tropical cyclone Felleng caused torrential rain, and flooding and landslides destroyed hundreds of houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-spider.org/about-us/news/en/6428/2013-02-01t161200/international-chapter-activated-flooding-republic-seychelles|title=International Chapter activated for flooding in the Republic of Seychelles |publisher=United Nation |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/weather/2013/01/201312993838165255.html|title=State of Emergency declared in the Seychelles |publisher=Aljazeera|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
[[File:Victoria.jpeg|thumb|[[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], the capital of Seychelles]]
{{main|Politics of Seychelles}}
The Seychelles president, who is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], is elected by popular vote for a five-year term of office. The cabinet is presided over and appointed by the president, subject to the approval of a majority of the legislature.

The [[unicameral]] Seychellois parliament, the National Assembly or ''Assemblée Nationale'', consists of 34 members, 25 of whom are elected directly by popular vote, while the remaining nine seats are appointed proportionally according to the percentage of votes received by each party. All members serve five-year terms.

The [[Supreme Court of Seychelles]], created in 1903, is the highest trial court in Seychelles and the first court of appeal from all the lower courts and tribunals. The highest court of law in Seychelles is the Seychelles Court of Appeal, which is the court of final appeal in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bas.sc/seychelles-legal-system/the-judiciary|title=Tge Judiciary|publisher=Bar Association of Seychelles|accessdate= 18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seychelles' previous president [[France Albert René]] came to power after his supporters overthrew the first president [[James Mancham]] on 5 June 1977 in a [[coup d'état]] and installed him as president. René was at that time the prime minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seychelles Nation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Results reflect popular will, observers say  | work=Seychelles Nation | url=http://www.nation.sc/index.php?art=23584 | accessdate=30 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Seychelles re-elects President Michel  | work=Reuters | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/seychellesNews/idAFLDE74K0E820110521?sp=true  | accessdate=23 May 2011 | date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agence France-Presse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Vote buying claims mar Seychelles election |work=Agence France-Presse |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ix-TzZJRTJJ_PAHQoACqmS7xSQ3Q?docId=CNG.07d4a47a8ce76f0e07e322726bdf65a2.b1 |date=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525013907/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ix-TzZJRTJJ_PAHQoACqmS7xSQ3Q?docId=CNG.07d4a47a8ce76f0e07e322726bdf65a2.b1 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

René ruled as a [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] under a [[socialist]] [[one-party system]] until in 1993, when he was forced to introduce a multi-party system. During his tenure, he was accused of involvement in criminal activity. US Ambassador to Seychelles (1982–85) [http://adst.org/2015/04/seychelles-gangstas-paradise/ David Fischer] has stated publicly that René was complicit in money laundering and murder, among other things. He stepped down in 2004 in favour of his vice-president, [[James Michel]], who was re-elected in 2006 and again in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seychelles Nation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agence France-Presse&quot;/&gt;

The primary political parties are the ruling socialist [[People's Party (Seychelles)|People's Party]] (PP), known until 2009 as the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF), and the [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] [[Seychelles National Party]] (SNP). {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

There are 67 [[Raised coral atoll|raised coral islands]] in the [[Aldabra Group]], west of the Farquhar Group: [[Aldabra Atoll]] (comprising 46 islands—Grande Terre, Picard, Polymnie, Malabar, Île Michel, Île Esprit, Île aux Moustiques, Ilot Parc, Ilot Emile, Ilot Yangue, Ilot Magnan, Île Lanier, Champignon des Os, Euphrate, Grand Mentor, Grand Ilot, Gros Ilot Gionnet, Gros Ilot Sésame, Heron Rock, Hide Island, Île aux Aigrettes, Île aux Cèdres, Îles Chalands, Île Fangame, Île Héron, Île Michel, Île Squacco, Île Sylvestre, Île Verte, Ilot Déder, Ilot du Sud, Ilot du Milieu, Ilot du Nord, Ilot Dubois, Ilot Macoa, Ilot Marquoix, Ilots Niçois, Ilot Salade, Middle Row Island, Noddy Rock, North Row Island, Petit Mentor, Petit Mentor Endans, Petits Ilots, Pink Rock and Table Ronde), [[Assumption Island]], Astove and [[Cosmoledo Atoll]] (comprising 19 islands—Menai, Île du Nord (West North), Île Nord-Est (East North), Île du Trou, Goëlettes, Grand Polyte, Petit Polyte, Grand Île (Wizard), Pagode, Île du Sud-Ouest (South), Île aux Moustiques, Île Baleine, Île aux Chauve-Souris, Île aux Macaques, Île aux Rats, Île du Nord-Ouest, Île Observation, Île Sud-Est and Ilot la Croix).

=== Climate ===
The climate is equable although quite humid, as the islands are small,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6268.htm | title = Background Note: Seychelles | author = U.S. Department of State | accessdate =25 May 2010}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; classified by [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen-Geiger system]] as [[tropical rain forest]] (Af). The temperature varies little throughout the year. Temperatures on Mahé vary from {{convert|24|to|30|°C|°F|0}}, and rainfall ranges from {{convert|2900|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} annually at [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]] to {{convert|3600|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} on the mountain slopes. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is somewhat less on the other islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stgt.com/seychelles/html/climate.htm |title=Climate|publisher=STGT.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the coolest months, July and August, the average low is about {{convert|24|°C|°F|0}}. The southeast trade winds blow regularly from May to November, and this is the most pleasant time of the year. The hot months are from December to April, with higher humidity (80%). March and April are the hottest months, but the temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|31|°C|°F|0}}. Most of the islands lie outside the cyclone belt, so high winds are rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate&quot;/&gt;

Environmental legislation is very strict, and every tourism project must undergo an environmental review and a lengthy process of consultations with the public and conservationists. Seychelles is a world leader in [[sustainable tourism]].{{according to whom|date=February 2015}} The end result of this [[sustainable development]] is an intact and stable natural environment, which attracts financially strong visitors (150,000 in 2007) rather than short-term mass tourism. Since 1993 a law guarantees the citizens the right to a clean environment and at the same time obliges them to protect this environment. The country holds a record for the highest percentage of land under natural conservation—nearly 50% of the total land area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Like many fragile island ecosystems, Seychelles saw the loss of [[biodiversity]] when humans first settled in the area, including the disappearance of most of the [[giant tortoise]]s from the granitic islands, the felling of coastal and mid-level forests, and the extinction of species such as the [[Seychelles chestnut-flanked white-eye|chestnut flanked white eye]], the [[Seychelles parakeet]],  and the [[saltwater crocodile]]. However, extinctions were far fewer than on islands such as [[Mauritius]] or Hawaii, partly due to a shorter period of human occupation (since 1770). Seychelles today is known for success stories in protecting its flora and fauna. The rare [[Seychelles black parrot]], the national bird of the country, is now protected.

The granitic islands of Seychelles are home to about 75 endemic plant species, with a further 25 or so species in the [[Aldabra]] group. Particularly well-known is the [[coco de mer]], a species of palm that grows only on the islands of [[Praslin]] and neighbouring [[Curieuse]]. Sometimes nicknamed the &quot;love nut&quot; because of the shape of its fruit which, with the husk removed, presents a &quot;double&quot; coconut resembling buttocks, the coco de mer produces the world's heaviest seed pods. The [[jellyfish tree]] is to be found in only a few locations on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahe]]. This strange and ancient plant in a genus of its own (Medusagynaceae) has resisted all efforts to propagate it. Other unique plant species include the Wright's gardenia (''[[Rothmannia annae]]'') found only on [[Aride Island]] Special Reserve.

The [[freshwater crab]] genus ''[[Seychellum]]'' is endemic to the granitic Seychelles, and a further 26 species of crabs and 5 species of [[hermit crab]]s live on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haig&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Janet Haig|year=1984 |chapter=Land and freshwater crabs of the Seychelles and neighbouring islands |page=123 |editor=David Ross Stoddart |title=Biogeography and Ecology of the Seychelles Islands |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-90-6193-107-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAu6qogRHloC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] now populates many of the islands of Seychelles. The Aldabra population is the largest in the world. These unique reptiles can be found even in captive herds. It has been reported that the granitic islands of Seychelles supported distinct species of [[Seychelles giant tortoise]]s; the status of the different populations is currently unclear.

There are several unique varieties of orchids on the islands.

Seychelles hosts some of the largest [[Bird colony|seabird colonies]] in the world. The outer islands of Aldabra and Cosmoledo are home to the largest numbers. In [[granitic Seychelles]] the largest numbers are on [[Aride Island]] including the world's largest numbers of two species.

The marine life around the islands, especially the more remote coral islands, can be spectacular. More than 1,000 species of fish have been recorded.

=== Environmental issues ===
Since the use of [[speargun]]s and dynamite for fishing was banned through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960s, the wildlife is unafraid of [[Snorkeling|snorkelers]] and [[Scuba diving|divers]]. [[Coral bleaching]] in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., [[Silhouette Island]]).

Despite huge disparities across nations, Seychelles claims to have achieved nearly all of its [[Millennium Development Goals]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  17 MDGS and 169 targets have been achieved.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Environmental protection is becoming a cultural value.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Their government's Seychelles Climate Guide describes the nation's climate as rainy, with a dry season with an ocean economy in the ocean regions.  The Southeast Trades is on the decline but still fairly strong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteo.gov.sc/index.php/climate/climate-services/seychelles-climate-guide Seychelles Climate Guide, 2015, Ministry of Environment,Energy and Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly, weather patterns there are becoming less predictable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.expertafrica.com/seychelles/info/seychelles-weather-and-climate Seychelles weather and climate, see 'Blue Economy']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British gained control of the islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], they allowed the French upper class to retain their land. Both the French and British settlers used enslaved Africans, and although the British prohibited slavery in 1835, African workers continued to come. Thus the ''Gran blan'' (&quot;big whites&quot;) of French origin dominated economic and political life. The British administration employed Indians on [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] to the same degree as in Mauritius resulting in a small Indian population. The Indians, like a similar minority of Chinese, were confined to a merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Sa-Th/Seychelles.html |title=Culture of Seychelles |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through harmonious socioeconomic policies and developments{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} over the years, today Seychelles is described as a fusion of peoples and cultures. Numerous Seychellois are considered multiracial: blending from African, Asian and European descent to create a modern creole culture. Evidence of this harmonious blend is also revealed in Seychellois food, incorporating various aspects of French, Chinese, Indian and African cuisine.
[[File:St Francis Church Mahe.jpg|thumb|St Francis Church, Mahe]]
As the islands of Seychelles had no indigenous population, the current Seychellois are composed of people who have immigrated. The largest ethnic groups were those of African, French, [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] and [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] descent. French and English are official languages along with [[Seychellois Creole]], which is primarily based upon French, yet nowadays is often laced with English words and phrases.

The median age of the Seychellois was 32 years.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/se.html |title=Seychelles|publisher=CIA – The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{see also|Religion in Seychelles}}

According to the 2010 census, most Seychellois are Christians: 76.2% were Roman Catholic, pastorally served by the exempt [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Port Victoria o Seychelles|Diocese of Port Victoria or Seychelles]] (immediately dependent on the Holy See); 10.6% were Protestant, ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]] 6.1%, [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal Assembly]] 1.5%, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-Day Adventist]] 1.2%, other Protestant 1.6%).

Hinduism is practiced by 2.4%, and Islam by 1.6%. Other non-Christian faiths accounted for 1.1% of the population while a further 5.9% were non-religious or did not specify a religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

During the plantation era, [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]] and [[copra]] were the chief exports. In 1965, during a three-month visit to the islands, futurist [[Donald Prell]] prepared for the then [[crown colony]] Governor General, an economic report containing a scenario for the future of the economy.  Quoting from his report, in the 1960s, about 33% of the working population worked at plantations, and 20% worked in the public or government sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= D. B. Prell|title=Economic Study of the Seychelles Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_6yHAAACAAJ|year=1965|publisher=D.B. Prell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Ocean Tracking Station on Mahé was closed in August 1996 after the Seychelles government attempted to raise the rent to more than $10,000,000 per year.

Since independence in 1976, per capita output has expanded to roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labour force, compared to agriculture which today employs about 3% of the labour force. Despite the growth of tourism, farming and fishing continue to employ some people, as do industries that process coconuts and vanilla.

{{As of|2013}}, the main export products are processed fish (60%) and non-fillet frozen fish (22%).&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/syc/all/show/2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime agricultural products currently produced in Seychelles include [[sweet potatoes]], vanilla, coconuts and cinnamon. These products provide much of the economic support of the locals. Frozen and canned fish, copra, cinnamon and vanilla are the main export commodities.

Since the [[Great Recession|worldwide economic crises of 2008]], the Seychelles government has prioritised a curbing of the [[budget deficit]], including the containment of [[social welfare]] costs and further [[privatisation]] of public enterprises. The government has a pervasive presence in economic activity, with public enterprises active in petroleum product distribution, banking, imports of basic products, telecommunications and a wide range of other businesses. According to the 2013 [[Index of Economic Freedom]], which measures the degree of limited government, market openness, regulatory efficiency, rule of law, and other factors, economic freedom has been increasing each year since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Index of Economic Freedom|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/seychelles|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national currency of Seychelles is the [[Seychellois rupee]]. Initially tied to a basket of international currencies it was depegged and allowed to be devalued and float freely in 2008 on the presumed hopes of attracting further foreign investment in the Seychelles economy.

=== Tourism ===
{{Further|Tourism in Seychelles}}
[[File:Seychelles 083.JPG|thumb|Aircraft at Seychelles International Airport]]
In 1971, with the opening of [[Seychelles International Airport]], tourism became a significant industry, essentially dividing the economy into plantations and tourism. The tourism sector paid better, and the plantation economy could only expand so far. The plantation sector of the economy declined in prominence, and tourism became the primary industry of Seychelles.

In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. These incentives have given rise to an enormous amount of investment in real estate projects and new resort properties, such as project TIME, distributed by the World Bank, along with its predecessor project MAGIC.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Despite its growth, the vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991–1992 due largely to the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seychellestour.com/seychelles-guide/economy/ |title=Seychelles economy – Seychelles Travel Guide |publisher=Seychellestour.com |date= |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, small-scale manufacturing and most recently the offshore financial sector, through the establishment of the [http://www.fsaseychelles.sc/ Financial Services Authority] and the enactment of several pieces of legislation (such as the International Corporate Service Providers Act, the International Business Companies Act, the Securities Act, the Mutual Funds and Hedge Fund Act, amongst others).

During March 2015, Seychelles allocated Assumption island to be developed by India.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-develop-two-islands-in-Indian-Ocean/articleshow/46533103.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Although multinational oil companies have explored the waters around the islands, no oil or gas has been found. In 2005, a deal was signed with US firm Petroquest, giving it exploration rights to about 30,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; around Constant, Topaz, Farquhar and Coëtivy islands until 2014. Seychelles imports oil from the Persian Gulf in the form of refined petroleum derivatives at the rate of about {{convert|5700|oilbbl/d}}.

In recent years oil has been imported from Kuwait and also from Bahrain. Seychelles imports three times more oil than is needed for internal uses because it re-exports the surplus oil in the form of bunker for ships and aircraft calling at [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]]. There are no refining capacities on the islands. Oil and gas imports, distribution and re-export are the responsibility of Seychelles Petroleum (Sepec), while oil exploration is the responsibility of the Seychelles National Oil Company (SNOC).

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Seychelles}}

Until the mid-19th century, little formal education was available in Seychelles. The Catholic and Anglican churches opened mission schools in 1851. The Catholic mission later operated boys' and girls' secondary schools with religious Brothers and nuns from abroad even after the government became responsible for them in 1944.

A teacher training college opened in 1959, when the supply of locally trained teachers began to grow, and in short time many new schools were established. Since 1981 a system of free education has been in effect requiring attendance by all children in grades one to nine, beginning at age five. Ninety percent of all children attend nursery school at age four.

The literacy rate for school-age children rose to more than 90% by the late 1980s. Many older Seychellois had not been taught to read or write in their childhood; adult education classes helped raise adult literacy from 60% to a claimed 100% in 2014.

There is a total of 68 schools in Seychelles. The public school system consists of 23 [[Kindergarten|crèches]], 25 primary schools and 13 secondary schools. They are located on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]], [[Praslin]], [[La Digue]] and [[Silhouette Island|Silhouette]]. Additionally, there are three private schools: École Française, International School and the Independent School. All the private schools are on Mahé, and the International School has a branch on [[Praslin]]. There are seven post-secondary (non-tertiary) schools: the Seychelles Polytechnic, School of Advanced Level Studies, Seychelles Tourism Academy, University of Seychelles Education, Seychelles [[Institute of Technology]], Maritime Training Center, Seychelles Agricultural and Horticultural Training Center and the National Institute for Health and Social Studies.

The administration launched plans to open a university in an attempt to slow down the [[brain drain]] that has occurred. [[University of Seychelles]], initiated in conjunction with the [[University of London]], opened on 17 September 2009 in three locations and offers qualifications from the University of London.

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Seychelles}}

The [[music of Seychelles]] is diverse, a reflection of the fusion of cultures through its history. The [[folk music]] of the islands incorporates multiple influences in a syncretic fashion, including African rhythms, aesthetic and instrumentation—such as the zez and the bom (known in Brazil as [[berimbau]]), European [[contredanse]], [[polka]] and [[mazurka]], French folk and pop, [[sega music|sega]] from [[Mauritius]] and Réunion, [[taarab]], [[soukous]] and other pan-African genres, and [[Polynesia]]n, Indian and [[Arcadia]]n music.

A form of percussion music called contombley is popular, as is [[Moutya]], a fusion of native folk rhythms with Kenyan [[benga music|benga]]. Kontredans (based on European contredanse) is popular, especially in District and School competitions during the annual Festival Kreol (International Creole Festival). Moutya playing and dancing can often be seen at beach bazaars. Their main languages are Seslwa Creole of The French Language, French and English.

The main daily newspaper is the ''[[Seychelles Nation]]'', dedicated to local government views and current affairs and topics. Other political parties operate other papers such as ''Regar''. Foreign newspapers and magazines are readily available in most bookshops and newsagents. The papers are mostly written in [[Seychellois Creole]], French and English.

The main television and radio network is operated by the [[Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation]] which offers locally produced news and discussion programmes in the Seychellois Creole language. Broadcasts run between 3pm and 11:30pm on weekdays and longer hours during the weekends. There are also imported English and French language television programmes imported on Seychellois terrestrial television and international satellite television has grown rapidly in recent years.

The Military of Seychelles is the Seychelles People's Defence Force which consists of a number of distinct branches:  including an Infantry Unit, Coast Guard, Air Force and a Presidential Protection Unit. India has and continues to play a key role developing the military of Seychelles. After handing over 2 [[Trinkat-class patrol vessel|SDB Mk5 patrol vessels]] namely INS Tarasa and INS Tarmugli to [[Seychelles Coast Guard]], built by [[GRSE]] which were subsequently renamed SCG Constant and SCG Topaz, India also gifted a [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] Maritime Patrol aircraft built by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-08/news/55894379_1_k-dhowan-maritime-security-indian-ocean &quot;India gifts second fast attack craft INS Tarasa to the Seychelles Coast Guard&quot;]. ''Times of India''. 8 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; India also signed a pact to develop the [[Assumption Island]], one of the 115 islands that make up the country. Spread over {{convert|11|km2|0|abbr=on}}, it is strategically located in the Indian Ocean, north of [[Madagascar]]. The island is being leased for development of infrastructure, a euphemism for developing strategic assets by India.&lt;ref&gt;Shubhajit Roy (12 March 2015) [http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/india-seychelles-sign-four-pacts-to-boost-security-cooperation/ &quot;India to develop strategic assets in 2 Mauritius, Seychelles islands&quot;]. ''The Indian Express''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incarceration ===
Seychelles has the highest incarceration rate in the world, having edged out the United States in 2012. As of June, 2014, Seychelles had 868 prisoners per 100,000 people. [http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/seychelles].

{{Further|List of countries by incarceration rate}}

=== Modern piracy ===
Seychelles has become a key participant in the fight against [[piracy]], which is perhaps the cause of their out-sized incarceration rate. President [[James Michel]] said [http://www.worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/a-pirate-s-prison-tucked-inside-seychelles-paradise/c1s4825/#.VayUIflViko] that piracy costs between $7 and 12 million a year to the international community; the pirates cost 4% of the Seychelles GDP, including direct and indirect costs for the loss of boats, fishing, and tourism, and the indirect investment for maritime security; and between 2008 and 2009, local fishing suffered a 46% loss.
 
Help has arrived from abroad. The [[United Arab Emirates]] sent five patrol boats, the United States gave a drone, the [[PR China]] offered two patrol planes, [[Luxembourg]] provided a speedboat and Italy continues to send Navy boats to patrol the coasts.

The '''Bajuni Islands''' (also known as the '''Bajun Islands'''&lt;ref name=hay&gt;{{citation|jstor=1787038|title= The Bajun Islands and Birikau|first= C. Wightwick|last= Haywood|journal= The Geographical Journal|volume= 85|issue= 1 |year=1935|pages= 59–64|doi=10.2307/1787038}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Baajun Islands''') are an [[archipelago]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], situated on the southern coast of [[Somalia]], from [[Kismayo]] to [[Ras Kiyamboni]] (not to be confused with [[Ras Kamboni]]). They lie at the northern end of a string of [[reef]]s that continues south to [[Zanzibar]] and [[Pemba Island|Pemba]].

==Geography==
Administratively, the islands are within the [[Lower Juba]] region of Somalia.

There are six main islands:
* [[Chandra Island|Chandra]] (2.95 km²),
* [[Chovaye]] (also spelled Tovai;&lt;ref name=hay/&gt; {{coord|-0.8720|42.1593}}) (5.46 km²),
* [[Chula Island|Chula]] (also spelled Tula;&lt;ref name=hay/&gt; {{coord|-1.0052|42.0364}}) (1.99 km²),
* [[Koyama (island)|Koyama]] (6.38 km²),
* [[Darakasi]] (1.99 km²) and
* [[Ngumi]] (2.56 km²).
Chula with the village of Ndowa is the only island with a significant population.

Other islands of minor importance are: Kandha Iwu, Fuma, Ilisi and the island of Kismayo (actual Kismayo harbor), the latter of which was attached to the coast in 1961 during the construction of Kismayo Port.

==History==
The islands, as well as the extreme southern area of present-day Somalia, were part of [[British East Africa]] prior to World War I. They were later transferred to Italy after the war.&lt;ref name=hay/&gt; According to [[C. Wightwick Haywood]], then a British official in Kismayo, who visited the islands in 1913, the only inhabited islands in the chain were Tovai (i.e., Chovaye - the biggest island in the chain) and the nearby Tula (i.e. Chula). Each of these two islands were no more than 3 miles long and a mile across. Maize, millet, sweet potatoes and coconuts were grown. The residents of the islands at the time, whom Haywood thought to be of [[Arab people|Arab]] and/or [[Persian people|Persian]] descent, built [[dhow]]s, which the British official considered &quot;excellent sea boats&quot;.&lt;ref name=hay/&gt;

On his 1913 trip, Haywood saw ruins of what he described as a &quot;fair-sized town&quot; on the Tovai (Chovaye) Island. He was impressed by stone carvings, and thought that the ruins had been left by people &quot;of a superior culture&quot; to the residents of his day. He mentioned that somewhat similar stone scrollwork could also be seen on houses in the [[Lamu Islands]] in present-day [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=hay/&gt;

==Demographics==
The islands are today mainly inhabited by the eponymous [[Bajuni people]]. All Bajuni inhabitants of Koyama island belong to the Nowfali sub-clan.

The '''Sa'ad ad-Din Islands''' ({{lang-so|''Sacadin jasiiradaha''}}, {{lang-ar|سعد الدين إد جزر}}), also [[Sa'ad ad-Din Islands#Etymology|Romanized]] as '''Sa'ad-ed-din'''{{sfn|H.N. Moldenke and A.L. Moldenke|1980|p=502}} and known as the '''Zeila Archipelago''',{{sfn|Jason Gurney|1966|p=74}} are group of [[island]]s off the northern coast of [[Somalia]]. They are situated near the ancient city of [[Zeila]].{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 273}}

==Etymology==
The name for the [[archipelago]] comes from the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]] [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] who was killed by Emperor [[Yeshaq I]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] on the main island in 1415.{{sfn|Philip Briggs|2012|p=10}}{{sfn|Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi|2001|p=16}} Along with his name, there many different spelling for the island such as ''Sa'ad ed Din'',{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 273}} ''Sa'ad-ed-din'',{{sfn|H.N. Moldenke and A.L. Moldenke|1980|p=502}} and ''Sa'ad-ad-Din''.{{sfn|Frederick Mercer Hunter|1877|p=11}} The archpeliogo is also known as the ''Zeila Archipelago''{{sfn|Jason Gurney|1966|p=74}} and the ''Sa'ad ad-Din group''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chdjc&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
The Sa'ad ad-Din archipelago is made of six small island all of which are low-lying and have sandy [[beaches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chdjc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefbase.org/global_database/dbr1,12,SOM,270.aspx |title=ReefBase:: Global Database: Resources - Overview - Eastern Africa - Somalia |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yfo6ul&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persga.org/Files/Common/Sea_Birds/Reginal_Status_of_Seabirds.pdf |title=Regional Status of Breeding Seabirds in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these islands are ''Sa'ad ad-Din'' and ''Aibat'',&lt;ref name=&quot;xtuhus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persga.org/Files/Common/MPA/4_Survey_Design_final_fINAL_1.pdf |title=Survey design for Proposed Marine Protected Areas |page=29 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are six and nine miles off the coast of [[Zeila]], respectively.{{sfn|National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|2007|p=176}} There is also a [[lighthouse]] at Aibat.{{sfn|National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|2007|p=176}}

==Environment==
The Sa'ad ad-Din Islands are well known for their splendid [[coral reefs]] similar to those found on the southern coast of [[Oman]].{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 273}} These reefs are the most diverse and well formed coral reefs on the coast of the [[Gulf of Aden]]&lt;ref name=&quot;gkftu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/somalia/documents/more_info/country_environmental_profile_somalia_en.pdf |title=Country Environmental Profile for Somalia |page=8 |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the largest in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;werff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persga.org/Files//Common/MPA/MPA_Network_DetailedReport_2003.pdf |title=Development and management of a network of marine protected areas in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region |page= 745|date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From provincial counts, ninety-nine different species of [[coral]] from forty-three different [[genera]]s have been found on the islands.{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 273}}

There are also a hundred and thirty-two different species of [[Coral reef fish|coral fish]] found around the archipelago. Many of these species include those also found in the [[Red Sea]], Gulf of Aden, and the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 274}}

The island of Sa'ad ad-Din and Aibat (called ''Ceebaad'' in [[Somali language|Somali]]){{sfn|National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|2007|p=175}} both are sites of major bird colonies.{{sfn|Nigel Redman|2009|p= 29}} On the island of Sa'ad ad-Din alone, there were more than 100,000 breeding pairs recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;xtuhus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persga.org/Files/Common/MPA/4_Survey_Design_final_fINAL_1.pdf |title=Survey design for Proposed Marine Protected Areas |page=20 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and other [[NGO]] worked with local authorizes to establish protected areas and monitor fishers on the islands.{{sfn|United Nations Environment Programme.|2005|p=132}}

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the archipelago are [[Somali people|Somalis]] from the [[Gadabuursi]] sub-clan, a sub-division of the larger [[Dir (clan)|Dir clan]].{{sfn|Élisée Reclus|1866|p= 204}} The locals have established [[Coral reef fish|reef fishing]] communities on the islands.{{sfn|T. R. McClanahan|2000|p= 274}}{{sfn|M. H. Schleyer, Robert M. Baldwin|1999|p=10}}

The '''Chagos Archipelago''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|ɡ|oʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|ɡ|ə|s}}) or '''Chagos Islands''' (formerly the '''Bassas de Chagas''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3665462 |title=Track of the Calcutta East Indiaman, over the Bassas de Chagas in the Indian Ocean |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the '''Oil Islands''') is a group of seven [[atoll]]s comprising more than 60 individual tropical [[island]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] about {{convert|500|km}} south of the [[Maldives]] archipelago. This chain of islands is the southernmost [[archipelago]] of the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]], a long submarine mountain range in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=im0125|name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chagos forms a [[terrestrial ecoregion]] together with the Maldives and the [[Lakshadweep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0125 |name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands and their surrounding waters are a vast oceanic Environment Preservation and Protection Zone (EPPZ) (Fisheries Conservation and Management Zone (FCMZ) of {{convert|544000|km2}}), an area twice the size of the UK's land surface.

Officially part of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], the Chagos were home to the [[Chagossians]] for more than a century and a half until the [[United Kingdom]] evicted them between 1967 and 1973 to allow the [[United States]] to build a military base on [[Diego Garcia]], the largest of the Chagos Islands. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia is inhabited, and only by military and civilian contracted personnel.

The sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago is being [[Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute|disputed]] between the UK and [[Mauritius]]. The United Kingdom excised the archipelago from [[Outer islands of Mauritius|Mauritian territory]] prior to Mauritius' independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;real&quot;/&gt;

The Chagos group is a combination of different [[coralline rock]] structures topping a [[submarine ridge]] running southwards across the centre of the Indian Ocean, formed by volcanoes above the [[Réunion hotspot]]. Unlike the Maldives, there is no clearly discernible pattern in the atoll arrangement, which makes the whole archipelago look somewhat chaotic. Most of the coralline structures of the Chagos are submerged reefs.

The Chagos contain the world's largest coral [[atoll]] (The Great Chagos Bank). It also has one of the healthiest reef systems in the cleanest waters in the world, supporting half the total area of good quality reefs in the Indian Ocean. As a result, the ecosystems of the Chagos have so far proven resilient to [[climate change]] and environmental disruptions.

On 1 April 2010, the British government [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] established the Chagos Archipelago as the world's largest [[marine reserve]]. At 640,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is larger than [[France]] or the US state of [[California]]. It doubled the total area of environmental no-take zones worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=North Sea Marine Cluster|title=Managing Marine Protected Areas|url=http://nsmc.eu.com/Marine-Protected-Areas-Report-3.pdf|publisher=NSMC|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protection of the marine reserve will be guaranteed for the next five years thanks to the financial support of the [[Ernesto Bertarelli|Bertarelli]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=PA |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/billionaire-saves-marine-reserve-plans-2077437.html |title=Billionaire saves marine reserve plans |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2010-09-12 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the Marine Reserve would appear to be an attempt to prevent any resettlement by the evicted natives in the 1960s and 70s. Leaked US Cables have shown the FCO suggesting to the US counterparts that setting up a protected no-take zone would make it &quot;difficult, if not impossible&quot; for the islanders to return. The reserve was then created in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rob Evans and Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-cables-diego-garcia-uk |title=WikiLeaks: Foreign Office accused of misleading public over Diego Garcia &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2 December 2010|accessdate=2013-10-20 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauritius initiated on 20 December 2010 proceedings against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge the legality of the MPA which the United Kingdom declared around the Chagos Archipelago.

On 18 March 2015, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] unanimously held that the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] (MPA) which the UK declared around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 violates international law. The [[Prime Minister of Mauritius]] pointed out that it is the first time that the UK's conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago has been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal. He qualified the ruling as an important milestone in the relentless struggle, at the political, diplomatic and other levels, of successive Governments over the years for the effective exercise by Mauritius of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. The tribunal considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument, holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius, and have bound the UK ever since. It found that the UK's commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding. The Tribunal also found that the United Kingdom’s undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius when no longer needed for defence purposes is legally binding. This establishes that, in international law, Mauritius has real, firm and binding rights over the Chagos Archipelago, and that the United Kingdom must respect those rights. The Tribunal went on to hold that the United Kingdom had not respected Mauritius’ binding legal rights over the Chagos Archipelago. It considered the events from February 2009 to April 2010, during which time the MPA proposal came into being and was then imposed on Mauritius.&lt;ref name=&quot;alla&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503231218.html | title=Mauritius: MPA Around Chagos Archipelago Violates International Law - This Is a Historic Ruling for Mauritius, Says PM | publisher=http://allafrica.com/ | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;govmu.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.govmu.org/English/News/Pages/MPA-around-Chagos-Archipelago-violates-international-law-%E2%80%93-This-is-a-Historic-ruling-for-Mauritius,-says-PM.aspx | title=MPA around Chagos Archipelago violates international law – This is a Historic ruling for Mauritius, says PM | publisher=[[Government Portal of Mauritius]] | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Chagos large.png|thumb|The Chagos Archipelago.&lt;br/&gt;([[Atoll]]s with areas of dry land are named in green)]]
The land area of the islands is 56.13&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (21.7 sq. miles), the largest island, [[Diego Garcia]], having an area of 32.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total area, including [[lagoon]]s within [[atoll]]s, is more than 15,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 12,642&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are accounted by the [[Great Chagos Bank]], the largest acknowledged atoll structure of the world (the completely submerged [[Saya de Malha Bank]] is larger, but its status as an atoll is uncertain). The [[Continental shelf|shelf]] area is 20,607&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], which borders the corresponding zone of the [[Maldives|Maldive Islands]] in the north, has an area of 639,611&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (including [[territorial waters]]).

The largest individual islands are Diego Garcia (32.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Eagle (Great Chagos Bank, 3.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Île Pierre (Peros Banhos, 1.40&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Eastern Egmont (Egmont Islands, 2.17&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Île du Coin (Peros Banhos, 1.32&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Île Boddam (Salomon Islands, 1.27&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The number of atolls in the Chagos Archipelago is given as four or five in most sources, plus two island groups and two single islands, mainly because it is not recognised that the [[Great Chagos Bank]] is a huge atoll structure (including those two island groups and two single islands), and because it is not recognisd that [[Blenheim Reef]] has islets or cays above or just reaching the high-water mark.

In addition to the seven atolls with dry land reaching at least the high-water mark, there are nine reefs and [[bank (topography)|banks]], most of which can be considered permanently submerged atoll structures. They are listed in the table from north to south:

The deep oceanic waters around the Chagos Islands, out to the 200 nautical mile limit, include an exceptional diversity of undersea geological features (such as 6000 m deep trenches, oceanic ridges, and sea mounts). These areas almost certainly harbour many undiscovered and specially adapted species. Although the deepwater habitats surrounding the islands have not been explored or mapped in any detail, work elsewhere in the world has shown that high physical diversity of the sea floor is closely linked to a high diversity of species.

===Resources===
[[File:Salomons Atoll in the Chagos.jpg|thumb|[[Salomon Atoll]] is one of the many above water features of the Chagos Archipelago]]
[[File:Chagos 022.jpg|thumb|The Chagos Archipelago is a hotspot of [[biodiversity]] in the Indian Ocean]]
The main [[natural resources]] of the area are [[coconut]]s and [[fish]]. The licensing of [[Fishing industry|commercial fishing]] used to provide an annual income of about two million dollars for the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] authorities, however licenses have not been given since October 2010, when the last one expired after the creation of the no-take marine reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040621/text/40621w13.htm#40621w13.html_sbhd2 |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 21 Jun 2004 (pt 13) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of [[Diego Garcia]], where joint UK-US military facilities are located. Construction projects and various services needed to support the military installations are done by military and contract employees from the UK, [[Mauritius]], the [[Philippines]], and the US. There are currently no industrial or agricultural activities on the islands. All the water, food and other essentials of daily life are shipped to the island. An independent feasibility study led to the conclusion that resettlement would be &quot;costly and precarious&quot;. Another feasibility study, commissioned by organisations supporting resettlement, found that resettlement would be possible at a cost to the British taxpayer of £25 million. If the Chagossians return, they plan to re-establish [[copra]] production and fishing, and to begin the commercial development of the islands for tourism.

Until October 2010, [[Skipjack tuna|Skipjack]] (Euthynnus pelamis) and [[yellowfin tuna]] (''Thunnus albacares'') were fished for about two months of the year as their year-long migratory route takes them through Chagos waters. While the remoteness of the Chagos offers some protection from extractive activities, legal and illegal fishing have had an impact. There is considerable [[poaching]] of turtles and other marine life. Sharks, which play a vital role in balancing the food web of tropical reefs, have suffered sharp declines from [[illegal fishing]] for their fins and as [[bycatch]] in legal fisheries. [[Sea cucumber]]s, which cleanse sand, are poached to feed Asian markets.

===Climate===
The Chagos Archipelago has a [[Tropical climate|tropical]] [[oceanic climate]]; hot and [[humid]] but moderated by [[trade winds]].
Climate is characterised by plenty of sunshine, warm temperatures, showers and light breezes.
December through February is considered the rainy season (summer monsoon); typical weather conditions include light west-northwesterly winds and warmer temperatures with more rainfall. June to September is considered the drier season (winter), characterised by moderate south-easterly winds, slightly cooler temperatures and less [[rainfall]]. The annual mean rainfall is 2600&amp;nbsp;mm (100&amp;nbsp;inches), varying from 105&amp;nbsp;mm (4&amp;nbsp;inches) during August to 350&amp;nbsp;mm (14&amp;nbsp;inches) during January.

==Sovereignty dispute==
{{Main|Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute}}
The Chagos had been part of [[Mauritius]] since the 18th century when the French first settled the islands. All of the islands forming part of the French colonial territory of [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (as Mauritius was then known) were ceded to the British in 1810 under the Act of Capitulation signed between the two countries. In 1965, prior to Mauritian independence, the UK split the archipelago from the territory of Mauritius to form the British Indian Ocean Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;real&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2012/04/06/mauritius_chagos_archipelago_diego_garcia_99999.html|title=Time for UK to Leave Chagos Archipelago|publisher=Real clear world|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations' resolutions banned the dismemberment of colonial territories before independence. Mauritius has repeatedly asserted that the British claim that the Chagos Archipelago is one of its territories is a violation of law and of UN resolutions. The UK has stated that it has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Chagos but has also said that the Chagos will be returned to Mauritius once the islands are no longer required for defence purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;real&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nazareth Bank-1794 Samuel Dunn Wall Map of the World in Hemispheres - Geographicus - World2-dunn-1794.jpg|thumb|The Chagos as ''Bassas de Chagas'' on 1794 [[Samuel Dunn (mathematician)|Samuel Dunn]] map section]]

===Early history===
According to Southern [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] [[oral tradition]], local traders and fishermen were occasionally lost at sea and got stranded in one of the islands of the Chagos. Eventually they were rescued and brought back home.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIAS Press&quot;&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias|Romero-Frias, Xavier]], (2012) ''Folk tales of the Maldives'', NIAS Press, ISBN 978-87-7694-104-8, ISBN 978-87-7694-105-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, these islands were judged to be too far away from the [[Maldives]] to be settled permanently by [[Maldivians]]. Thus for many centuries the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours.

In Maldivian lore the whole group is known as ''Fōlhavahi'' or ''Hollhavai'' (the latter name in the Southern Maldives [[Addu Atoll|Adduan]] dialect of [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]). There are no separate names for the different atolls of the Chagos in the Maldivian oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Romero-Frias, Xavier, ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom.'' Barcelona 1999, ISBN 84-7254-801-5. Chapter 1 ''&quot;A Seafaring Nation&quot;,'' page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
[[Portuguese Discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to discover the archipelago. Although Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Mascarenhas|Pedro de Mascarenhas]] (1470–23 June 1555) is credited with having discovered the islands during his voyage of 1512–13, there is little corroborative evidence for this; cartographic analysis points to 1532 or later. [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese]] seafarers named the group as '''Bassas de Chagas''',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Huddart et al. ''The oriental navigator, or, New directions for sailing to and from the East Indies'', ISBN 978-0-699-11218-5&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pt|Chagas}} (wounds) referring to the [[Holy Wounds]] of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. They named as well some of the atolls, such as Diego Garcia and [[Peros Banhos]] Atoll, mentioned as ''Pedro dos Banhos'' in 1513 by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Purdy (hydrographer)|John Purdy]], ''Memoir, descriptive explanatory, accompany new chart Ethiopic or southern Atlantic Ocean, western coasts South-America, Cape Horn Panama'', ISBN 1-141-62555-5&lt;/ref&gt; Neglected by the Portuguese, this lonely and isolated group, economically and politically uninteresting, was never made part of the [[Portuguese Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Boxer, ''The Portuguese Seaborne Empire, 1415-1825'', Knopf 1969, ISBN 978-0-09-097940-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest and most interesting description of the Chagos, before [[coconut]] trees grew widely on the islands, was written by Manoel Rangel, a castaway from the Portuguese ship ''Conceição'' which ran aground on the Peros Banhos reefs in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Gomes de Brito. ''[[História trágico-marítima]]. Em que se escrevem chronologicamente os Naufragios que tiverao as Naos de Portugal, depois que se poz em exercicio a Navegaçao da India.'' Lisboa 1735&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[France|French]] were the first to lay a claim on the Chagos after they settled [[Réunion]] (in 1665) and Isle de France (now [[Mauritius]], in 1715). The French began issuing permits for companies to establish coconut oil plantations on the Chagos in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US-UK-Diego Garcia (1770-2004)|url=http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=diego_garcia|website=History Commons|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1786 the Chagos Islands and Diego Garcia were claimed for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. However, the territory was ceded to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] by treaty only after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat, in 1814. The Chagos were governed from Mauritius, which was by that time also a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christian Nauvel|title=A Return from Exile in Sight? The Chagossians and Their Struggle|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights|date=2007|volume=5|issue=1|page=6|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v5/n1/4/Nauvel.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, when the first successful colony was founded on Diego Garcia, the largest island, [[coconut]] [[plantation]]s were established on many of the atolls and isolated islands of the archipelago. Initially the workers were slaves, but after 1840 they were freemen, many of whom were descended from those earlier slaves. They formed an inter-island culture called ''[[Ilois]]'' (a [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] word meaning Islanders).

Commander [[Robert Moresby]] made a survey of the Chagos on behalf of the [[British Admiralty]] in 1838. After Moresby took measurements of most of the atolls and reefs, the archipelago was charted with relative accuracy for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Hydrographic Services]]. Admiralty Charts.

===20th century===
[[File:Diplomatic Cable signed by D.A. Greenhill, dated August 24, 1966.jpg|thumb|[[Diplomatic cable]] signed by [[Denis Greenhill, Baron Greenhill of Harrow|D.A. Greenhill]], 1966, relating to the [[Depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago|depopulation of the Chagos Archipelago]] stating &quot;Unfortunately along with the birds go some few Tarzans or [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Man Friday]]s.&quot;]]
On 31 August 1903 the Chagos Archipelago was administratively separated from the [[Seychelles]] and attached to [[Mauritius]].

In November 1965, the UK purchased the entire Chagos Archipelago from the then self-governing colony of Mauritius for £3 million to create the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), with the intent of ultimately closing the plantations to provide the British territory from which the US would conduct its military activities in the region. On 30 December 1966, the US and the UK executed an Agreement through an Exchange of Notes which permit the [[United States Armed Forces]] to use any island of the BIOT for defence purposes for 50 years (until December 2016), followed by a 20-year optional extension (to 2036) to which both parties must agree by December 2014. {{As of|2010}}, only the atoll of Diego Garcia has been transformed into a military facility.

In April 1966 the British Government bought the entire assets and real property of the [[Seychellois]] Chagos Agalega Company, which owned all the islands of the BIOT, for £600,000 and administered them as a government enterprise while awaiting US funding of its proposed facilities, with an interim objective of paying for the administrative expenses of the new territory. However, the plantations, both under their previous private ownership and under government administration, proved consistently unprofitable due to the introduction of new oils and lubricants in the international marketplace, and the establishment of vast coconut plantations in the [[East Indies]] and the [[Philippines]].

Between 1967 and 1973, the entire population was removed against its will from the islands and moved to [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]] to make way for a joint United States-United Kingdom military base on [[Diego Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7075361.stm|title=Exiles lose appeal over benefits|date=2 November 2007|work=[[BBC Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1971, [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] US Naval construction battalions arrived on Diego Garcia to begin the construction of the Communications Station and an airfield. To satisfy the terms of an agreement between the UK and the US for an uninhabited island, the plantation on Diego Garcia was closed in October of that year.
The plantation workers and their families were initially moved to the plantations on [[Peros Banhos]] and [[Salomon Atoll|Salomon atolls]] in the northwest of the archipelago; those who requested were transported to the Seychelles or Mauritius. In 1972, the UK decided to close all the remaining plantations throughout the Chagos, and deported the Ilois to the Seychelles or Mauritius. The then-independent Mauritian government refused to accept the islanders without payment, and in 1973, the UK gave the Mauritian government an additional £650,000 to resettle the islanders. However, despite this islanders often found themselves in woefully inadequate housing and living conditions.

Currently, the only human structures on the islands are located in the joint defence and [[Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia]], although the Plantation house and other structures left behind by the Ilois are still standing, however left abandoned and decaying. Other uninhabited islands, especially in the Salomon Atoll, are common stopping points for long-distance [[Cruising (maritime)|yachtsmen]] travelling from [[Southeast Asia]] to the [[Red Sea]] or the coast of [[Africa]], although a permit is required to visit the outer islands.

===Current situation===
Diego Garcia is currently the only inhabited island in the Chagos, all of which comprise the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], usually abbreviated as &quot;BIOT&quot;. It is an [[Overseas territory of the United Kingdom]], and the [[Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory|Government of the BIOT]] consists of [[Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory|Commissioner]] appointed by the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]]. The Commissioner is assisted by an Administrator and small staff, and is based in London and resident in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. This administration is represented in the Territory by the Officer commanding British Forces on Diego Garcia, the &quot;Brit Rep&quot;. Laws and regulations are promulgated by the Commissioner and enforced in the BIOT by Brit Rep.

There are no indigenous peoples living on the island, and the UK represents the Territory internationally. A local government as normally envisioned does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1,700 armed services personnel and 1,500 civilian contractors, mostly American, are stationed on Diego Garcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Garcia &quot;Camp Justice&quot; 7º20'S 72º25'E|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/diego-garcia.htm|website=Global Security.org|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two transnational political issues which affect the BIOT, through the British government.

First, the island nation of Mauritius claims the Chagos Archipelago (which is coterminous with the BIOT), including Diego Garcia. A subsidiary issue is the Mauritian opposition to the 1 April 2010 UK Government's declaration that the BIOT is a [[Marine Protected Area]] with fishing and extractive industry (including oil and gas exploration) prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20111223113708 |url=http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/05/14/mauritius-to-reiterate-its-conditions-for-renewed-talks-with-uk-on-chagos/ |title=Mauritius to reiterate its conditions for renewed talks with UK on Chagos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the issue of compensation and repatriation of the former inhabitants of several of the archipelago's atolls, exiled since 1973, continues in litigation and {{As of|2010|8|23|lc=y}} has been submitted to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] by a group of former residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7052088.ece|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110924105418/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7052088.ece|archivedate=2011-09-24|title=Chagossians fight for a home in paradise|date=2010-03-06 |work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigation continues {{As of|2012|lc=y}} regarding the right of return for the displaced islanders and Mauritian sovereignty claims. In addition, advocacy on the Chagossians' behalf continues both in the United States and in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic#International Human Rights: The Chagos Islanders]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[WikiLeaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak|cablegate]] disclosure (2010)
According to Wikileaks CableGate documents,&lt;ref name='09LONDON1156'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/05/09LONDON1156.html | title = Hmg Floats Proposal For Marine Reserve Covering | accessdate = 2010-12-02 | date = 2009-05-15 | publisher = [[WikiLeaks]] | work = Embassy London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK proposed in 2009 that the BIOT become a &quot;marine reserve&quot;.
The summary paragraph of the referenced diplomatic cable follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;HMG would like to establish a marine park or reserve providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on May 12. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park—the world's largest—would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT's former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cable from AMEMBASSY LONDON; DTG 150700ZMAY09; SUBJECT: Political Counselor Richard Mills for reasons 1.4 b and d.&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== People and language ==
[[File:Diego garcian.jpg|thumb|A [[Chagossians|Chagossian]], known as &quot;Samson&quot;, photographed by a [[US National Geodetic Survey]] team in 1969.]]

=== Former natives ===
The islanders were known as the [[Ilois]] (one French Creole word for &quot;islanders&quot;) and they numbered about 9,000 total, and 7,500 native Chagossians before European settlers. They were of mixed African, South Indian, Portuguese, English, French and Malay descent and lived very simple, spartan lives in their isolated archipelago working in the coconut and sugar plantations, or in the fishing and working in the small textile industries. Few remains of their culture have been left, although their language is still spoken by some of their descendants in [[Mauritius]] and the UK.

The inhabitants of Chagos were speaking [[Chagossian Creole]], also known as Ilois creole, a [[French language|French]] [[Creole language|Creole]] which has not been properly researched from the linguistic point of view.

The island names are a mixture of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Ilois|Ilois Creole]].

=== Present occupants ===
{{As of|2012}}, the islands have a transitory 'population' of about 3,000 – 300 [[United Kingdom|British]] government personnel and 2,700 [[United States Army|American Army]], Navy and Air-Force personnel.

The Catholics are pastorally served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis]], which includes the BIOT.

==Ecology==
The [[biodiversity]] of the Chagos archipelago and its surrounding waters is one of the main reasons it is so special. But this incredible diversity is under threat as at least 60 species that call Chagos home are already on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Coral'''
[[File:Ctenella.jpg|thumb|right|The [[brain coral]] ''[[Ctenella chagius]]'' is endemic to the reefs of the Chagos]]

The reefs host at least 371 species of coral including the [[endemism|endemic]] [[brain coral]] ''[[Ctenella chagius]]''. The coral cover is dense and healthy even in deep water on the steep outer reef slopes. Thick stands of branching [[staghorn coral]] (''Acropora'' sp) protect the low-lying islands from wave erosion. Despite the loss of much of the coral in a [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]] event in 1998 the recovery in the Chagos has been remarkable and overall coral cover increases year on year.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Fish'''

The reefs are also home to at least 784 species of fish that stay near to the shores of the islands including the endemic Chagos [[clownfish]] (''[[Amphiprion chagosensis]]'') and many of the larger [[wrasse]] and [[grouper]] that have already been lost from over-fishing in other reefs in the region.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

As well as the healthy communities of reef fish there are significant populations of pelagic fish such as [[manta ray]]s (''Manta birostris''), [[whale shark]]s, normal [[sharks]], and [[tuna]]. Shark numbers have dramatically declined as a result of illegal fishing boats that seek to remove their fins and also as accidental by-catch in the two tuna fisheries that used to operate seasonally in the Chagos.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Birds'''
[[File:Seabirds nesting on South Brother island in the Chagos Archipelago.jpg|thumb|right|Seabirds nesting on [[Three Brothers (islands), Chagos|South Brother island]] in the Chagos Archipelago]]

Seventeen species of breeding [[seabirds]] can be found nesting in huge colonies on many of the islands in the archipelago, and 10 of the islands have received formal designation as Important Bird Areas, by [[BirdLife International]]. This means that Chagos has the most diverse breeding seabird community within this tropical region. Of particular interest are the large colonies of sooty terns (''[[Sterna fuscata]]''), brown and lesser noddies (''[[Anous stolidus]]'' and ''[[Anous tenuirostris]]'') wedge-tailed shearwaters (''[[Puffinus pacificus]]'') and [[red-footed boobies]] (''Sula sula'').{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Mammals'''
Environments of Chagos Archipelago provides rich biodiversity and support varieties of [[cetacean]] species in the vicinity,&lt;ref&gt;http://chagos-trust.org/sites/default/files/images/ChagosNews21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; mostly the [[toothed whale]]s such as [[sperm whale|sperm]], [[pilot whale|pilot]], [[orca]], [[risso's dolphin]]s, and other dolphins such as [[spinner dolphin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.whales.org/blog/2010/02/concerns-about-chagos-archipelago-mpa-proposal&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Donkeys roaming free on the island that were left behind when the Ilois were relocated.

'''Turtles'''

The remote islands make perfect undisturbed nursery sites for nests of green (''[[Chelonia mydas]]'') and hawksbill (''[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]'') turtles. The populations of both species in Chagos are of global significance given the [[critically endangered]] status of hawksbills and the [[endangered]] status of [[green turtles]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. Chagos turtles were heavily exploited during the previous two centuries, but they and their habitats are now well protected by the administration of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] and are recovering well.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Crabs'''
[[File:Coconut Crab on Chagos Archipelago.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coconut crab]]s are the world's largest terrestrial arthropod and live in one of the most undisturbed populations in the Chagos]]

The [[coconut crab]] (''Birgus latro'') is the world's largest terrestrial [[arthropod]], reaching over one metre in leg span and 3.5-4 kilos in weight. As a juvenile it behaves like a hermit crab and uses empty coconut shells as protection but as an adult this giant crab climbs trees and can crack through a coconut with its massive claws. Despite its wide global distribution, it is rare in most of the areas it is found. It is primarily threatened by over-collection for food, but also as ornaments for sale to tourists and as bait for fish traps. Demand for coconut crabs as souvenirs is strong, and other threats include habitat destruction and predation from introduced species such as rats. The coconut crabs on Chagos constitute one of the most undisturbed populations in the world. An important part of their biology is the long distances their young can travel as larvae. This means the Chagos coconut crabs are a vital source for replenishing other [[overexploitation|over-exploited]] populations in the Indian Ocean region.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Insects'''
{{main|List of Lepidoptera of the Chagos Archipelago}}
A total of 113 species of insect have been recorded from the Chagos Islands.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

'''Plants'''

The Chagos Islands have been colonised by plants since there was sufficient soil to support them&amp;nbsp;– probably less than 4,000 years. Seeds and spores arrived on the emerging islands by wind and sea, or from passing [[seabird]]s. The native [[flora]] of the Chagos Islands is thought to comprise forty-one species of flowering plants and four [[fern]]s as well as a wide variety of [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[fungi]] and [[cyanobacteria]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

Today, the status of the Chagos Islands’ native [[flora]] depends very much on past exploitation of particular islands. About 280 species of flowering plants and ferns have now been recorded on the islands, but this increase reflects the introduction of non-native plants by humans, either accidentally or deliberately. Because some of these non-native species have become invasive and pose a threat to the native ecosystems, plans are being developed to control them. On some islands, native forests were felled to plant coconut palms for the production of [[copra oil]]. Other islands remain unspoiled and support a wide range of habitats, including unique ''[[Pisonia]]'' forests and large clumps of the gigantic fish poison tree (''[[Barringtonia asiatica]]''). Unspoiled islands provide us with the biological information that we need to re-establish the native plant communities on heavily altered islands. These efforts will ultimately help to improve the [[biodiversity]] of the Chagos Islands.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

==Conservation efforts==

===Past===
[[File:Sampling work in the Chagos.JPG|thumb|right]]The Chagos is one of the few marine locations in the world where there are almost no ongoing, direct human impacts over almost all of its areas. In April 2010 the Chagos was designated as a [[marine reserve]] by the UK government. That will, among other things, allow the area to serve as a reference site for global scientific research to aid in understanding of such things as [[climate change]], [[tropical marine ecosystem]]s and the impacts of [[commercial fishery|commercial fisheries.]]

Successive UK governments, both [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour]] and [[Conservative]], have supported environmental conservation of the Chagos and have resisted attempts to allow the exiled Chagossians to return. They have committed to treat the whole area as a [[World Heritage site]]. In 2003, the UK government established an Environment (Protection and Preservation) Zone under Article 75 of the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. This zone extends 200 [[nautical miles]] from the islands. On eastern [[Diego Garcia]], the largest island of the Chagos and the site of a UK–US military facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/diego-garcia.htm |title=Diego Garcia &quot;Camp Justice&quot; |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has designated the very large [[lagoon]] and the eastern arm of the atoll and seaward reefs as a &quot;wetland of international importance&quot; under the [[Convention on Wetlands of International Importance]] (the [[Ramsar Convention]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20010505022128 |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/wh/reviews/wetlands/t11.htm |title=Wetland and marine protected areas on the world heritage list }}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
On 1 April 2010 Britain announced the creation of the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area]], the world's largest continuous marine protected reserve with an area of {{convert|545,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Eilperin2010&gt;{{Citation

 | archivedate = 4 April 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This followed an effort led by [[The Chagos Environment Network]],&lt;ref name=&quot;protect&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://protectchagos.org |title=Welcome to the Chagos Conservation Trust &amp;#124; Chagos Conservation Trust |publisher=Protectchagos.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration of nine leading conservation and scientific organisations seeking to protect the rich biodiversity of the Chagos Archipelago and its surrounding waters. The Chagos Environment Network cites several reasons for supporting a protected area:

;Wildlife : The Chagos no-take marine reserve would maintain the pure and unpolluted waters of Chagos, providing a safe refuge for its rich marine life, including many threatened animals, such as turtles and sharks. Seabirds and nesting turtles too will benefit from the additional conservation measures that a protected area will bring. Both groups are recovering from severe depredations of the past in a way that is not possible in most places.
;Fisheries : World fish stocks have declined because the human race exploits the sea. A large ‘no-take’ protected area will assist fish population recovery, potentially increasing fish numbers over a much wider area. The protected area will also provide a temporary refuge for migratory species, such as tuna, from exploitation. However, there have been arguments for keeping a controlled fishery, the fees from which could be used to support conservation efforts in the area.
;People : With regard to the forcibly removed Chagossian people, whatever the outcome of legal challenges brought by Chagossian groups against the UK government, the Chagos Environment Network believes that the Chagos Archipelago need conservation now and that this will be beneficial to everyone under all future legal scenarios. The Chagos Environment Network urged that the Chagos Islands and their surrounding waters be designated as a no-take marine reserve &quot;without prejudice” to the outcome of the legal process. This designation would mean that the Chagos Islands and their resources would remain healthy no matter what the future holds, but that conservation arrangements could be modified if necessary in the light of a change in circumstances.
;Science : The Chagos is one of the few marine locations in the world where there are almost no ongoing, direct human impacts over almost all of its areas (with the obvious exception of the huge military base on the main island). The marine reserve could serve as a reference site for global scientific research to aid in our understanding of such things as [[climate change]], [[tropical marine ecosystem]]s and the impacts of [[commercial fishery|commercial fisheries]].
;Deep ocean : The deep oceanic waters around the Chagos Islands, out to the 200 nautical mile limit, include an exceptional diversity of undersea geological features (such as 6,000 m deep trenches, oceanic ridges and sea mounts). These areas almost certainly harbour many undiscovered and specially adapted species.
;UK international commitments : The creation of the Chagos Protected Area would be an important contribution by the UK to at least seven international environmental conventions. It would also contribute to the UK’s global commitments, such as halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010, establishing marine protection networks by 2012, and restoring depleted fish stocks to sustainable levels by 2015.

The UK government opened a three-month [[public consultation]] which ended after the 5 March 2010 about conservation management of the Chagos Islands and its surrounding waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO&quot;&gt;{{Wayback |date=20100206233541 |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/21153320/mpa-consultation-101109 |title=Consultation on Whether to Establish a Marine Protected Area in the British Indian Ocean Territory }}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ritchies Archipelago locale.png|thumb|200px|right|Outline map of the [[Andaman Islands]], with Ritchie's Archipelago highlighted (in red)]]
'''Ritchie's Archipelago''' is a cluster of smaller islands which lie some {{convert|25|-|30|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Great Andaman]], the main island group of the [[Andaman Islands]]. the Andamans are located in the [[Bay of Bengal]], bordering with the [[Andaman Sea]] and are some {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} south of the nearest [[Asia]]n mainland, [[Cape Negrais]] in [[Myanmar]].

The [[archipelago]] comprises some 4 larger islands, 7 smaller islands and several [[islet]]s, extending in a roughly north-south chain, parallel to the main Great Andaman group. [[Baratang|Baratang Island]] and [[South Andaman Island]] lie to the west across [[Diligent Strait]]; the active [[volcano]] [[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]] is some {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}} further to the east.

The islands were originally populated by the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Great Andamanese]] peoples, in particular the tribal and linguistic grouping known as [[Aka-Bale]]. However, as the populations of the various [[Andamanese]] indigenous peoples declined greatly in the decades following the establishment of [[colonialism|colonial]] settlements by the [[British Raj]] (and later, independent [[India]]), the indigenous communities of these islands have vanished. The present population of the islands consists of immigrant [[Demographics of India|Indian]] and a few [[Karen people|Karen (Burmese)]] settlers.

Together with the rest of the Andamans, Ritchie's Archipelago is incorporated into the [[India]]n [[union territory]] of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], and part of the [[Andaman district]]. It is administered by the ''[[tehsil]]'' (a local government sub-division, roughly equivalent to a ''[[county]]'') of [[Port Blair tehsil|Port Blair]]. The territory's capital and administrative centre (also called [[Port Blair]]), is located approximately {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} to the southwest of the archipelago, accessible via a 3-5 hour ferry trip.

The 2001 census of India reported 8,247 people living on the three inhabited islands of Ritchie's Archipelago: Havelock Island (5354), Neil Island (2868), and John Lawrence Island (25).

[[File:Elephant Beach, Havelock Island.jpg|thumb|right|Beach view on [[Havelock Island]]]]
[[File:Neil Island , Andaman.jpg|thumb|A beach on Neil Island]]
The main islands in the archipelago (in decreasing order of approximate size) are:
* [[Havelock Island]] - {{convert|113.93|km2|abbr=on}} (pop. 5354)
* [[Henry Lawrence Island]] - {{convert|55|km2|abbr=on}}, named after Brigadier General [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence]]
* [[John Lawrence Island]] - {{convert|41.98|km2|abbr=on}} (pop. 25), named after [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence]], Viceroy of India
* [[Sir William Peel Island]] - {{convert|23|km2|abbr=on}} (more commonly abbreviated to ''Peel I.'')
* [[Wilson Island (Ritchie's Archipelago)|Wilson Island]] - {{convert|14|km2|abbr=on}}
* [[Outram Island]] - {{convert|13|km2|abbr=on}}, named after Lieutenant General [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|James Outram]]
* [[Neil Island]] - {{convert|18.90|km2|abbr=on}} (also ''Neill I.'') (pop. 2868)
* [[Nicholson Island (Ritchie's Archipelago)|Nicholson Island]] - {{convert|1.8|km2|abbr=on}}, named after Brigadier General [[John Nicholson (East India Company officer)|John Nicholson]]
* [[Inglis Island (Ritchie's Archipelago)|Inglis Island]] - {{convert|1.4|km2|abbr=on}} (also called ''East I.'')
* [[Sir Hugh Rose Island]] - {{convert|0.6|km2|abbr=on}} (often abbreviated to ''Hugh Rose I.''), named after [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn]]
* [[Middle Button Island]] - {{convert|0.4|km2|abbr=on}}
* [[North Button Island]] - {{convert|0.25|km2|abbr=on|2}}
* [[South Button Island]] - {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|2}}

The islands of Ritchie's Archipelago run in a closely spaced arc which extends about {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} from the southern-most Hugh Rose I. to North Button I., with the strait between them and Great Andaman ranging from {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} to less than {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}}. Most of the islands are clustered closely together separated by only narrow, almost river-like channels. The exceptions are Hugh Rose and Neil Is to the south of Havelock, and the three small Button Is which are smaller outliers to the north of the group.

The interior of most of the islands consists of undulating hills and plains, with a [[topography]] not exceeding {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]]. Occasionally the land rises reasonably abruptly from the sea to a domed plateau, and there are a few rocky coastal cliffs; however, in the main the coastlines are relatively flat, interspersed by both rocky and sand beaches and some low-lying [[lagoon]]s and [[estuary|estuaries]] on the larger islands. [[Coral reef]]s surround many of the islands, particularly on the &quot;sea-ward&quot; (i.e., eastern) coastlines.

Havelock, John Lawrence, Henry Lawrence, Peel and Outram Is. have a few [[creek (tidal)|tidal creeks]] winding into their interiors; in general freshwater [[stream]]s are few.

==History==
The archipelago is named after an 18th-century [[British Empire|British]] [[marine surveyor]], John Ritchie, who spent nearly two decades in the employ of the Council of Bengal charting and documenting the Andamans and surrounding regions.  The individual islands are largely named after British generals and civil officials serving in India at the time of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

Of the archipelago which now bears his name, Ritchie's accounts and maps were the first reliable sources of information on the islands, which until then were very sketchily known to Europeans. Ritchie was one who championed that the British administration in India make further investigation and use of the Andamans. During Ritchie's time these entreaties were largely ignored. Perhaps frustrated and disillusioned after years of thankless work under difficult circumstances, Ritchie requested to be returned for home leave, which he was in 1787. An extract from his parting note to his superiors explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The condition of my health being such as requires an immediate change of climate... after a series of 19 years continuous service in the office of Marine Surveyor, I hope there is no impropriety in my requesting the favour, also... to continue my allowance to me... It is a small salary, and the receipt of it has been the only advantage I have ever reaped from the Company's service, and because my Line of Service, from its singularity, has had no gradation of advancement... whilst its Duties have been uncommonly severe, uncommonly hazardous, and equally unprofitable; for what advantage could be obtained from tracking a Labyrinth of Woods and Rivers? Or from exploring the Shoals of a shelving and broken Sea Coast? All of which uninhabited, and seldom visited, except perhaps in the disastrous case of shipwreck... In the meantime it has been from my Labours, that the Hon'ble Company have obtained all authentic knowledge of the Sea Coast and Tide Rivers of their possessions in Bengal, together with other services more important and beneficial.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie overstates the &quot;uninhabited&quot; nature of the islands, since he was well aware of the existence of the indigenous tribes, and had spent some time in the company and direct presence of several of them&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years after Ritchie's departure, an attempt was made to set up a colony in the Andamans, but this was aborted after only a few years. It was not until 1867 that a permanent European presence was established, when the whole islands were [[annexation|annexed]] by the British and a [[penal colony]] established at [[Port Blair]] on [[South Andaman Island]].

==Population==
The populated islands in the archipelago (in decreasing order of approximate size) are:
* Havelock Island - {{convert|113.93|km2|abbr=on}} (pop. 5354)
* John Lawrence Island - {{convert|41.98|km2|abbr=on}} (pop. 25) 
* Neil Island - {{convert|18.90|km2|abbr=on}} (also ''Neill I.'') (pop. 2868)

The '''Outer Islands''' or '''Coralline Seychelles''' (archipelago) is a collective term for those [[island]]s of the [[Seychelles]] that are not on the shallow [[Seychelles Bank]] (Seychelles Plateau) which defines the location of the granitic Inner Islands [[archipelago]] to the east.  The local [[Seychellois Creole]] name for the outer islands is '''''Zil Elwannyen Sesel''''', while the French name is ''Îles Eloignées''. They are all of [[coral]] formation, and in the western [[Indian Ocean]].

==History==
Until 2008, the islands were outside the administrative and electoral [[Districts of Seychelles]]. 
in 2008 the [[shrimp farm]] closed on [[Coetivy Island]] which caused a wave of job-seekers coming to [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]].
The ministry of tourism was granted a free hand on these islands in order to settle down the unrest of the population, and declared it a district.
It formed the [[IDC]] to control the islands, and prepared a program called '''''1 hotel 1 island'''''. each island in the group should be leased to a hotel, which will in turn built several residential homes and facilities on those islands. It required removal of the [[Protected Area Status|PA]] from the islands. 
at first. finding hotel chains was difficult, so Coetivy received a prison, and thus creating jobs for the people who came back to their island.
Other islands received questionable facilities as well. [[Marie Louise Island]] a jail. [[Assumption Island]] an Army base. 
but other places has developments of resorts. the population increased again, for the first time in a century, from 500 in 2008 to 700 in 2016.   
Conservation in the outer islands is managed by [[Island Conservation Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandconservationseychelles.com Island Conservation Seychelles] . accessed 8.2.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Save Our Seas]] Foundation manages the nature preserve of [[D'Arros Island]] and its neighboring atolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saveourseas.com/blog/the_darros_group_of_island_becomes_a_natural_reserve_managed_by_save_our_se Save Our Seas Foundation: &quot;The D’Arros Group of Island becomes a natural reserve managed by Save our Seas Foundation&quot;] . accessed 8.2.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The coral islands are flat with elevated [[coral reef]]s at different stages of formation. They are generally low-lying, and often form [[atoll]]s around a central lagoon. The soils of the Corraline Seychelles are generally sandy and infertile, and hold little fresh water. 
The Inner Islands or [[Granitic Seychelles]], by contrast, are composed of [[granite]] on the Seychelles Bank plateau, and are ancient fragments of [[continental crust]]. They are generally more mountainous, humid, and populated.
The Outer Islands comprise {{convert|216.57|km2|mi2}} or 46% of the total land area of the Seychelles, but hold less than 1% of the population of the country. The coral Outer Islands are located at distances of {{convert|230|-|1150|km|mi}} from [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]], the nation's principle island, located in the granitic Inner Seychelles.

===Five groups===
The Outer Islands are divided into five groups:
#[[Southern Coral Group]] — [[Île Platte]] and [[Coëtivy Island]]; land area {{convert|9.906|km2|mi2}}
#[[Amirante Islands]] — 3 [[atoll]]s (including [[Desroches Island|Desroches Island - ''Île Desroches'']], 5 single sand cays including [[D'Arros Island]]), and 3 uplifted sand cays; land area {{convert|11.582|km2|mi2}}
#[[Alphonse Group]] — [[Alphonse Atoll]] and [[St. François Atoll]] (Bijoutier-St. François); land area {{convert|2.21|km2|mi2}}
#[[Aldabra Group]] — [[Aldabra Atoll]], [[Assumption Island]], [[Cosmoledo|Cosmoledo Atoll]], and [[Astove Island]]; land area {{convert|180|km2|mi2}}
#[[Farquhar Group]] — [[Farquhar Atoll]], [[Providence Atoll]] (Providence-Cerf), and [[St. Pierre Island]]; land area {{convert|12.84|km2|mi2}}

==Demography==
The lack of natural fresh water sources and infertile soils of these islands can sustain human life only with difficulty. {{As of|2016}} the population is 701 although this figure increases during the short summer vacation when [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahe]] people come to work in tourism and fishing on the islands. There are 12 inhabited islands (2016), The major are Coetivy with 260 and Desroches with a 100.

'''Langkawi''', officially known as '''Langkawi the Jewel of Kedah''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Langkawi Permata Langkawi'') is an [[archipelago]] of 104 islands in the [[Andaman Sea]], some 30&amp;nbsp;km off the mainland coast of northwestern [[Malaysia]]. The islands are a part of the state of [[Kedah]], which is adjacent to the [[Thailand|Thai]] border. On 15 July 2008, [[Sultan Abdul Halim]] of [[Kedah]] had consented to the change of name to Pulau Langkawi in conjunction with his [[Golden Jubilee]] Celebration as Pulau Langkawi is its own state. By far the largest of the islands is the eponymous '''Langkawi Island''' with a population of some 64,792, the only other inhabited island being nearby Tuba Island. Langkawi is also an [[Districts of Malaysia|administrative district]] with the town of [[Kuah]] as largest town. Langkawi is a [[duty-free]] island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC Langkawi|accessdate=11 August 2009|title=Shopping in Langkawi|url=http://www.abclangkawi.com/index.php/shopping-in-langkawi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Langkawi Malaysia Dataran-Helang-05.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Dataran Helang (Eagle Square)]]
The name Langkawi is thought to have existed by the early 15th century, although in the 16th century the [[island]] of Langkawi was also marked on maps variously as Langa, Langka, Lansura, and Langapura.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09FgUMSg6b0C&amp;pg=PR8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Legends of Langkawi|author= Mohamed Zahir Haji Ismail |publisher=Utusan Publications &amp; Distributors |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many suggestions for the origin of the name of Langkawi.  According to one interpretation, Langkawi means island of the reddish-brown [[eagle]] in colloquial [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesMurphy2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holly Hughes|author2=Sylvie Murphy|author3=Alexis Lipsitz Flippin|author4=Julie Duchaine|title=Frommer's 500 Extraordinary Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajhU1AAacUsC|accessdate=9 February 2014|date=14 January 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-59518-3|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malay word for eagle is ''helang'' - which is shortened to &quot;lang&quot;, while ''kawi'' is the name of a red stone used as a chalk to mark goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends1&quot;/&gt; This interpretation was used to create the landmark sculpture of an eagle as the symbol of Langkawi at Dataran Helang (Eagle Square) in [[Kuah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS0_GehsGPwC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=the Rough Guide to Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei|authors=Charles de Ledesma, Mark Lewis, Pauline Savage |page=218 |publisher=Rough Guides |edition= 5th |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-1-84353-687-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.langkawi-insight.com/langkawi_000016.htm |title=Langkawi Eagle Square - Dataran Lang |work=Langkawi Insight }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is however widely believed that Langkawi is also the same as the Lanka or Langkapuri mentioned in Indian sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWy8DvqG-iEC&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malay Kingship in Kedah: Religion, Trade, and Society|author= Maziar Mozaffari Falarti |page=94|publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6842-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is thought to be related to [[Langkasuka]], an old kingdom thought by some to have links with Kedah, and ''puri'' means a castle with a moat or a palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;/&gt;  Some also thought that Langkawi means &quot;many beautiful islands&quot;, ''langka'' being a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;beautiful&quot; while ''wi'' means &quot;many&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends1&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, it was given the title of ''Langkawi Permata Kedah'' meaning &quot;Langkawi, the Jewel of Kedah&quot; in 2008 by Kedah's [[Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah]] as part of his [[golden jubilee]] to impress upon tourists that Langkawi is part of Kedah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/16/nation/20080716171300&amp;sec=nation |title=It's Langkawi Permata Kedah now |last=Majid |first=Embun |publisher=The Star Online |date=16 July 2008|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Langkawi had long been at the periphery of, but closely associated with, the domain of the old kingdom of [[Kedah Sultanate|Kedah]].  Legend tells of a great snake ''ular-besar'',  the custodian of the Langkawi Islands, to which a new king of Kedah must sacrifice a virgin daughter whenever he first ascended the throne, or when a war was declared with another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWy8DvqG-iEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malay Kingship in Kedah: Religion, Trade, and Society|author= Maziar Mozaffari Falarti |page=55|publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6842-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mao Kun map - Langkawi, Kedah, Penang.png|thumb|230px|[[Mao Kun map]] from ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' which is derived from the 15th century navigation maps of [[Zheng He]] showing Langkawi (龍牙交椅) next to Penang island (梹榔嶼)]]

The island of Langkawi was recorded in history by Chinese and other travellers.  It was called ''Long-ya-pu-ti'' (龍牙菩提) by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] traveller [[Wang Dayuan]] , and when the [[Ming Dynasty]] admiral [[Zheng He]] visited the region he marked the island as ''Long-ya-jiao-yi'' (龍牙交椅).  In the 15th century, it was known to [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] as Pulau Lada or Pepper Island as they came over to plant pepper. In 1691, the French general [[Augustin de Beaulieu]] recorded going to the island of &quot;Lancahui&quot; (Langkawi) to buy pepper,&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09FgUMSg6b0C&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Legends of Langkawi|author= Mohamed Zahir Haji Ismail |publisher=Utusan Publications &amp; Distributors |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beaulieu was required to obtain a license from Kedah's heir apparent then in [[Perlis]] before the ''[[penghulu]]'' or chief of Langkawi would sell pepper to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWy8DvqG-iEC&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malay Kingship in Kedah: Religion, Trade, and Society|author= Maziar Mozaffari Falarti |page=99|publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6842-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langkawi was historically home to seafarers, such as the ''[[Orang Laut]]'' (sea people) originally from the southern part of the Malay peninsula, as well as pirates and fishermen.  It had been thought to be cursed for a couple of centuries - according to local legend, in the late 18th century, a woman named [[Mahsuri]] was wrongfully accused of adultery and put to death, and she placed a curse on the island that would last for seven generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0LrqNu5-JEC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asian Culture and Heritage in a Globalising World: Diverging Identities in a Dynamic Region |editors= Ooi Giok Ling, Assoc Prof Rahil Ismail, Dr Brian J Shaw |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company |page=50|year= 2009 |isbn=978-0-7546-7261-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after Mahsuri's death, in 1821, the Siamese army invaded Kedah, and attacked Langkawi.   In the first attack, the locals decided to burn down the granary at [[Padang Matsirat]] to starve and drive out the Siamese army. The Siamese nevertheless finally captured the island in May 1822, killed its leaders, and many of the islanders were taken as slaves, while others were forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09FgUMSg6b0C&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Legends of Langkawi|author= Mohamed Zahir Haji Ismail |publisher=Utusan Publications &amp; Distributors |year=2000 |pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Siamese invasion, there was an estimated island population of 3,000–5,000, and only a small proportion was left after the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWy8DvqG-iEC&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malay Kingship in Kedah: Religion, Trade, and Society|author= Maziar Mozaffari Falarti |page=119|publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6842-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was recaptured from Siamese rule in a campaign against the Siamese in 1837.  In 1840–1841, the Sultan of Kedah, who went into exile after the Siamese attacks, was allowed to return by the Siamese, and the population of Langkawi islands recovered afterwards mainly due to settlement of immigrants from [[Sumatra]].  However, the ''Orang Laut'' who fled after the Siamese attacks did not returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWy8DvqG-iEC&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malay Kingship in Kedah: Religion, Trade, and Society|author= Maziar Mozaffari Falarti |page=121|publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2012 |isbn=978-0-7391-6842-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909, the islands came under British rule under the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  The middle of the channel between [[Tarutao]] and Langkawi would become the [[Malaysia–Thailand border|Siamese border]], and Tarutao would be part of Siam while all the Langkawi islands to the south would come under British rule. During the [[Second World War]], Siam took control briefly as [[British Malaya|Malaya]] fell to the Japanese.

Langkawi had been a haven for pirates which affected the northern part of the [[Malacca Strait]].  In a series of operations, between December 1945 and March 1946, the British cleared the pirates' land base in Langkawi and Tarutao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlDe_cmh3mgC&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Pirates in Paradise: A Modern History of Southeast Asia's Maritime Marauders|author= Stefan Eklöf |page=51|publisher=Nordic Institute of Asian Studies |year=2006 |isbn= 978-87-91114-37-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British continued to rule until Malaya gained its independence in 1957.

Langkawi remained as a quiet backwater until 1986, when the then Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] decided to transform it into a major tourist resort, helping to plan many of the islands buildings himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bound for Glory&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |publisher=Time magazine |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island rapidly grew as a tourist destination, and by 2012, it had received over 3 million tourists a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2013/06/20/langkawi-targets-4m-tourists-by-year-end/ |title= Langkawi targets 4m tourists by year-end |date=20 June 2013 |work=Free Malaysia Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lada.gov.my/v2/en/information/tourist-statistic.html |title=Tourist Statistics |work=Langkawi Development Authority }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

[[File:LangkawiMap.png|thumb|280px|Map of Langkawi]]
Langkawi, a cluster of 99 islands separated from mainland Malaysia by the [[Straits of Malacca]], is a district of the state of Kedah in Northern [[Malaysia]] and lies approximately 51&amp;nbsp;km west of Kedah. The total land mass of the islands is 47,848 [[hectares]]. The main island spans about 25&amp;nbsp;km from north to south and slightly more for east and west. The coastal areas consist of flat, [[alluvial plains]] punctuated with [[limestone]] [[ridges]]. Two-thirds of the island is dominated by forest-covered mountains, hills and natural vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.langkawi-online.com/pages/geography.php |title=Geography |work=Langkawi Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's oldest geological formation, Gunung Matchincang, was the first part of [[South-East Asia]] to rise from the [[seabed]] in the [[Cambrian]] period more than half a billion years ago. The oldest part of the formation is observable at Teluk Datai to the north-west of the island, where the exposed outcrop consists of mainly [[sandstone]] (quartzite) in the upper parts and [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] in the lower parts of the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infolangkawi.blogspot.com/2009/07/langkawi-history.html |title=Langkawi History |date=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
Langkawi receives more than {{convert|2400|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain annually. Langkawi has a true dry season from December until February while March to November is a long raining season. September is the wettest month, when it normally receives more than {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

==Demographics==

Only four of the 99 islands are inhabited - Langkawi (the main island), Tuba, Rebak and Dayang Bunting. The population is approximately 99,000, around 65,000 of them in Langkawi, of which 90% are Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mylangkawi.com/new/info/ginfo.htm |title=General Information |work=MyLangkawi.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other [[ethnic groups]] consist mainly of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] and [[Thai people|Thais]].

[[Islam]] is practised primarily by ethnic Malays. Other major religions are [[Hinduism]] (mainly among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]]), [[Buddhism]] (mainly among Chinese and [[Thai people|Thai]]) and [[Christianity]] (mostly Chinese).

[[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] is the official language and is used in formal occasions. [[English language|English]] is widely spoken and understood by the locals. Most natives speak a Langkawi variant of [[Kedah Malay]] with minorities speaking [[Chinese languages|Chinese]], [[Southern Thai language|Siamese]] and various [[Indian Malaysian|Indian languages]].

==Economy==
An agro-based economy of padi and rubber cultivation and fisheries is fast being overtaken by a tourism-driven economy, taking into consideration the natural, unspoiled, ecological beauty of the island and major governmental emphasis. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Northern Corridor Economic Region (NCER) development program is a Malaysia Government initiative to accelerate economic growth in the north of Peninsular Malaysia – encompassing the states of Perlis, Kedah, Penang and the north of Perak.

The target for NCER is to achieve increased tourism receipts per visitor from MYR1,890 (US$600) in 2005 to MYR3,034 (US$963) by 2012.

Annual tourist expenditure is targeted to increase from MYR9.0 billion (US$2.86 billion) in 2005 to MYR21.8 billion (US$6.9 billion) in 2012 and MYR64.5 billion (US$20.4 billion) in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klia.com.my/routeskl2008/pdf/LGK.pdf]  {{wayback|url=http://www.klia.com.my/routeskl2008/pdf/LGK.pdf |date=20081121084327 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:Langkawi Pantai Cenang 3.JPG|thumb|260px|Islands of Langkawi]]
[[File:Photo Mithun Ahamed.jpg|thumb|Landscape view of Langkawi Island]]
On 1 June 2007, Langkawi Island was given a [[International Network of Geoparks|World Geopark]] status by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Star Online|accessdate=24 December 2007|title=Langkawi given geopark status|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/8/nation/17962886&amp;sec=nation|date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of its main conservation areas in Langkawi Geopark are Machincang Cambrian Geoforest Park, Kilim Karst Geoforest Park and Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest park (Island of the Pregnant Maiden Lake). These three parks are the most popular tourism area within Langkawi Geopark. In 2014 Unesco allegedly issued a 'yellow card' warning threatening the status of the Geopark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/langkawi-risks-losing-geopark-status-after-unesco-yellow-card|title=Langkawi risks losing Geopark status after Unesco 'Yellow Card'|publisher=Themalaysianinsider.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Langkawi UNESCO Global Geopark status was due for renewal in 2015, of which upon thorough inspection by the appointed Geopark Inspectors, Langkawi was issued the Certificate of Membership dubbed the Green Card by Asia Pacific Geoparks Network, under the auspices of the Global Geopark Network (GGN).

Tourists can enter the island via ferry from Kuala Kedah, Kuala Perlis and Penang. Or by domestic flight from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) via [http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/my/en.html Malaysia Airlines], [[AirAsia]], [[Malindo Air]], [http://rayaniair.com/rairweb/index.php Rayani Air], or Subang Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (SZB) via Malindo Air and [[Fireflyz]] providing budget connection to the island. International connection is available from Singapore via [http://www.tigerair.com/sg/en/ Tigerair] and AirAsia, as well as from Guangzhou via AirAsia.

===Islands and beaches===

[[File:Chenang Beach.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Sunset at Chenang Beach (Pantai Cenang)]]
There are two main island areas: the Southern Islands, with a heavier tourist population and the islands to the north east which are more secluded with little tourist traffic. Langun Island has a fresh-water lake like Pregnant Maiden Lake only without the tourists and has Sand Spit Beach on its south-facing orientation. Dendang Island next to it forms a bay popular with Langkawi sailing yacht tour operators who favour the area for its natural beauty and peace. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Cenang Beach view, Langkawi.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Cenang Beach sunny view]]
Some of the most popular beaches are Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah, Burau Bay, Pantai Kok, and Datai Bay. Pantai Cenang is a picturesque beach with long stretches of fine white sand. It has numerous restaurants and bars for evening entertainment, several hosting live music and for watching the sun set. The beach is lined with tall coconut and [[casuarina]] trees. Pantai Tengah is separated from Cenang by a small cape. It too faces the setting sun and is populated more by hotels than bars, making it less busy in the evening. Burau Bay, fringed by rocky outcrops, is the favourite place of migratory birds in Langkawi. Pantai Kok is a quiet beach against a backdrop of limestone hills. Datai Bay has a combination of forests and sea, its white sandy beach is backed by lush forest.

[[File:Langkawi sky bridge.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The [[Langkawi Sky Bridge]] above the rainforest canopy]]

===Cable car and Sky Bridge===
The [[Langkawi Cable Car]] takes visitors up to the peak of Gunung Mat Chinchang, where the [[Langkawi Sky Bridge]] is located. The Sky Bridge was closed in 2012 for maintenance and upgrading, but reopened in February 2015, although work on the bridge is still ongoing as of September 2015.

The start of cable car ride is located in the Oriental Village where there are a number of attractions, including a 3-Dimensional art museum known as Art in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1323094 |title=Tun Mahathir officiates Langkawi 3D art museum|date= 7 February 2015 |work=The Sun Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kilim Karst Geoforest Park (The Kilim River)===

This area actually consists of three river estuaries that stretch from the Kisap village approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km to Tanjung Rhu and they are all interconnected. They are rich in wildlife and tourists may see hairy nosed sea otters, brown winged kingfishers, monitor lizards and swimming macaque monkeys. Limestone, inherently porous, forms caves and there are several in the mangroves. One of Langkawi's natural beauty spots is the Pirate Lagoon just outside the river. Technically this is a collapsed cave (hong) consisting of a cave entrance from the sea emerging into a hidden lagoon with towering, limestone escarpments and smaller caves. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Activities===

With Langkawi surrounded by the sea, there are various water-based activities to indulge in.

The '''Hawar Islands''' ({{lang-ar|جزر حوار}}; [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]: Juzur Ḥawār) is an [[archipelago]] of desert islands owned by [[Bahrain]], situated off the west coast of [[Qatar]] in the [[Gulf of Bahrain]] of the [[Persian Gulf]].

==Description==
The islands used to be one of the settlements of the Bahraini branch of the [[Dawasir]] who settled there in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=16 March 2001 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were first surveyed in 1820, when they were called the Warden’s Islands, and two villages were recorded.&lt;ref name=whs /&gt;  They are now uninhabited, other than a police garrison and a hotel on the main island; access to all but Hawar island itself is severely restricted.  Local fishermen are allowed to fish in adjacent waters and there is some recreational fishing and tourism on and around the islands.&lt;ref name=rambah11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/regional-initiatives/UAE_Workshop_Files_May2011/Fujairah_Workshop_May2011/All%20PDF%20documents%20Fujaira/BAHRAIN.pdf |title=Bahrain |work=[[Ramsar Convention]] |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh water has always been scarce; historically it was obtained by surface collection and even today, with the desalinisation plant, additional supplies have to be brought in.&lt;ref name=whs /&gt;

==Geography==
Despite their proximity to Qatar (they are only about {{convert|1|nmi|km}} from the Qatari mainland whilst being about {{convert|10|nmi|km|0|abbr=out}} from the main islands of Bahrain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EOcBE6VIikC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=International Maritime Boundaries : vol. IV |work=[[American Society of International Law]] |date=2002 |isbn=904111954X |page=2844}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the islands belong to [[Bahrain]], having been a part of a dispute between Bahrain and Qatar which was resolved in 2001.&lt;ref name=icj81&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=[[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] |date=16 March 2001 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were formerly coincident with municipality or ''Minţaqat'' Juzur Ḩawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the [[Southern Governorate]] of Bahrain. The land area of the islands is approximately 52&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawar-islands.com/iucn_evaluation.html |title=IUCN Evaluation of Nominations of Natural and Mixed Properties to the World Heritage List |work=Hawar-Islands.com |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are 36 islands in the group,&lt;ref name=manplan /&gt; many of the smaller islands are little more than sand or shingle accumulations on areas of exposed bedrock molded by the ongoing processes of sedimentation and accretion.
The WHS application named 8 major islands (see table hereafter), which conforms to the description of the islands when first surveyed as consisting of 8 or 9 islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/5483.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=13 June 2000 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been described as an archipelago of 16 islands.&lt;ref name=icj28&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/5479.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=9 June 2000 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janan island, to the south of Hawar island, is not legally considered to be a part of the group and is owned by Qatar.&lt;ref name=icj54&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=16 March 2001 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Socotra Cormorant.jpg|thumb|left|Socotra cormorant]]
==Flora and Fauna==
The islands are home to many bird species, notably [[Socotra cormorant]]s. There are small herds of [[Arabian oryx]] and [[Sand gazelle#Subspecies|sand gazelle]] on Hawar island, and the seas around support a large population of [[dugong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/regional-initiatives/UAE_Workshop_Files_May2011/Fujairah_Workshop_May2011/All%20PDF%20documents%20Fujaira/BAHRAIN.pdf |title=Bahrain |work=Ramsar Convention |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The islands were listed as a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=manplan&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/Hawar-MP.pdf |title=Hawar Islands Protected Area: Management Plan |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Bahraini government applied to have the islands recognised as a [[World Heritage Site]] due to their unique environment and habitat for endangered species;&lt;ref name=whs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawar-islands.com/Hawar_application.htm |title=Nomination file: The Hawar Archipelago |work=Government of Bahrain |date=11 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the application was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

==Administration==
The islands were formerly coincident with municipality or ''Minţaqat'' Juzur Ḩawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the [[Southern Governorate]] of Bahrain.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

[[File:Hawar Islands.jpg|thumb|Hawar Islands Resort.]]
==Tourism==
In 2014, a Best Western hotel with 140 rooms replaced a much smaller Hawar Islands Resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/TTN_249865.html |title=Best Western to open Bahrain resort next month |work=[[Trade Arabia]] |date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestwestern.com/about-us/press-media/press-release-details.asp?NewsID=965 |title=Best Western Unveils Arabian Island Retreat  |work=[[Best Western]] |date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the resort closed in mid-2016.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

== List of islands ==

=== Hawar archipelago ===

By far the largest island is [[Hawar]], which accounts for more than 41&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the 54.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; land area.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; Following in size are Suwād al Janūbīyah, Suwād ash Shamālīyah, Rubud Al Sharqiyah, Rubud Al Gharbiyah, and Muhazwarah (Umm Hazwarah).

The following were not considered as part of the Hawar islands in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) judgment, being located between Hawar and the Bahrain Islands and not disputed by Qatar, but have been included in the Hawar archipelago by the Bahrain government as part of the 2002 [[World Heritage Site]] application.&lt;ref name=whs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/Hawar-MP.pdf |title=Hawar Islands Protected Area: Management Plan |date=January 2003 |page=10 (map)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janan island, a small island south of Hawar island, was also considered in the 2001 {{abbr|ICJ|International Court of Justice}} judgment. Based on a previous agreement when both Qatar and Bahrain were under British protection, it was judged to be separate from the Hawar islands and so considered by the court separately.&lt;ref name=icj54 /&gt; It was awarded to Qatar.&lt;ref name=icj81 /&gt;

The '''Andaman and Nicobar Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|d|@|m|@|n|and|'|n|I|k|@|b|ar}}; {{Audio|Andaman.ogg|local}}), one of the seven union territories of India, are a group of islands at the juncture of the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Andaman Sea]].

The territory is {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Aceh]] in [[Indonesia]] and separated from [[Thailand]] and Myanmar ([[Burma]]) by the Andaman Sea. It comprises two island groups, the [[Andaman Islands]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], separated by the [[10th parallel north|10°N parallel]], with the Andamans to the north of this [[latitude]], and the Nicobars to the south. The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west.

The territory's capital is the Andamanese town of [[Port Blair]]. The total land area of these islands is approximately {{convert|7950|km2|abbr=on}}. The capital of Nicobar Islands is [[Car Nicobar]]. The islands host the [[Andaman and Nicobar Command]], the only tri-service geographical command of the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

The Andaman Islands are home to the only known Paleolithic people, the [[Sentinelese people]], who have no contact with any other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.and.nic.in/andaman/tribes.php|title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Administration|work=and.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===First inhabitants===

The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years. However, [[genetics|genetic]] and [[culture|cultural]] studies suggest that the indigenous [[Andamanese people]] may have been isolated from other populations since some time during the [[Middle Paleolithic]], which ended 30,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Palanichamy, Malliya G., Suraksha Agrawal, Yong-Gang Yao, Qing-Peng Kong, Chang Sun, Faisal Khan, Tapas Kumar Chaudhuri, and Ya-Ping Zhang. 2006. Comment on &quot;Reconstructing the Origin of Andaman Islanders. ''Science'' 311:470 (27th January 2006).
Paramjeet saluja is minister of Andaman and Nicobar&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups.

The Nicobar Islands appear to have been populated by people of various backgrounds. At the time of the European contact, the indigenous inhabitants were the [[Nicobarese people]], speaking a [[Mon-Khmer]] language; and the [[Shompen people|Shompen]], whose language is of uncertain affiliation. Both are unrelated to the Andamanese, but being closely related to the Myanmarese.

===Chola empire period===
[[Rajendra Chola I]] (1014 to 1042 CE), one of the Tamil [[Chola dynasty]] kings, conquered the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to use them as a strategic naval base to launch a naval expedition against the [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya Empire]] (a Buddhist empire based in the island of Sumatra, Indonesia). They called the islands '''''Tinmaittivu''''' (&quot;impure islands&quot; in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;goi1908&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Andaman and Nicobar Islands: Local Gazetteer |author=Government of India | publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta | year=1908 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/?id=rrwBAAAAYAAJ | quote=''... In the great Tanjore inscription of 1050 AD, the Andamans are mentioned under a translated name along with the Nicobars, as '''Nakkavaram''' or land of the naked people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maratha empire===
The islands also provided a temporary maritime base for ships of the [[Maratha Empire]] in the 17th century. The Maratha navy's admiral [[Kanhoji Angre]] established naval supremacy with a base in the islands and is credited with attaching those islands to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanonline.in/about/Profile/History/index.html |title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Origin &amp;#124; Andaman &amp; Nicobar Island History |publisher=Andamanonline.in |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marathiecards.com/Sarkhel_Kanhoji_Angre.htm |title=Welcome to Alibag / Alibaug.

===Danish colonial period and British Raj===
[[File:Andaman Cellular Jail.jpg|thumb|Andaman Cellular Jail]]
The history of organised European [[colonisation]] on the islands began when the Danish settlers of the [[Danish East India Company]] arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark,&lt;ref name=&quot;worldstatesmen.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=ben cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htm |title=Provinces of British India |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later (December 1756) Frederick's Islands (''Frederiksøerne''). During 1754–1756 they were administrated from [[Tranquebar]] (in continental [[Danish India]]). The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria between 14 April 1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for good.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldstatesmen.org&quot;/&gt;

From 1 June 1778 to 1784, [[Austria]] mistakenly assumed that Denmark had abandoned its claims to the Nicobar Islands and attempted to [[Austrian colonisation of Nicobar Islands|establish a colony]] on them,&lt;ref name=&quot;ColVoy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colonialvoyage.com/DanishP.html | title = Chronology of Danish Colonial Settlements | first = Marco | last = Ramerini | publisher = ColonialVoyage.com | accessdate = January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; renaming them '''Theresia Islands'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldstatesmen.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1789 the British set up a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island next to Great Andaman, where now lies the town of [[Port Blair]]. Two years later the colony was moved to [[Port Cornwallis]] on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.

[[Denmark]]'s presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;ColVoy&quot; /&gt; which made them part of [[British India]] in 1869.

In 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was to set up a [[penal colony]] criminal convicts from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The colony came to include the infamous [[Cellular Jail]].

In 1872 the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair.

===World War II===
{{main|Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands}}
During [[World War II]], the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]] of Netaji [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as &quot;Shaheed-dweep&quot; (Martyr Island) and &quot;Swaraj-dweep&quot; (Self-rule Island).

General [[A. D. Loganathan|Loganathan]], of the [[Indian National Army]] was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officers — Major Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasan—arrived at [[Lambaline Airport]] in [[Port Blair]]. On 21 March 1944 the Headquarters of the Civil Administration was established near the [[Gurudwara]] at Aberdeen Bazaar. On 2 October 1944, Col. [[A. D. Loganathan|Loganathan]] handed over the charge to Maj. Alvi and left Port Blair, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Black Days in Andaman and Nicobar Islands&quot; by [[Rabin Roychowdhury]], [Pub. Manas] Pubs. New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were reoccupied by British and Indian troops of the [[116th Indian Infantry Brigade]] on 7 October 1945, to whom the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered.

===Post Independence===
[[File:The British Occupation of the Nicobar Islands, 1945 SE5438.jpg|thumb|The British Occupation of the Nicobar Islands, 1945]]
During the independence of both India (1947) and [[Burma]] (1948), the departing British announced their intention to resettle all [[Anglo-Indians]] and [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]] on these islands to form their own nation, although this never materialised. It became part of the India in 1950 and was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Andaman and Nicobar Islands Development Report|series=State Development Report series|author=Planning Commission of India|edition=illustrated|publisher=Academic Foundation|year=2008|page=|isbn= 81-7188-652-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujf2N5O4iKgC|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

India has been developing defence facilities on the islands since the 1980s. The islands now have a key position in India's strategic role in the Bay of Bengal and the Malacca Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Brewster|url= https://www.academia.edu/7716140/Indias_Defence_Strategy_and_the_India-ASEAN_Relationship |title= India’s Defence Strategy and the India-ASEAN Relationship. Retrieved 24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 tsunami===
On 26 December 2004 the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were devastated by a {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} high [[tsunami]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. More than 2,000 people lost their lives, more than 4,000 children were orphaned or suffered the loss of one parent, and a minimum of 40,000 people were rendered homeless.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCLEE 30&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Sumatra-Andaman Islands Earthquake and Tsunami of December 6, 2004: Lifeline Performance |year=2007 |publisher=ASCE, Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering |location= Reston, VA |isbn=9780784409510 |url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5511 |editor=Carl Strand and John Masek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20141219065927/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5511 |archivedate=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst affected Nicobar islands were [[Katchal Island|Katchal]] and [[Indira Point]]; the latter subsided 4.25 metres and was partially submerged in the ocean. The lighthouse at Indira Point was damaged but has been repaired since then.
The territory lost a large amount of area which is now submerged.  The territory which was at {{convert|8073|km2|abbr=on}} is now merely at {{convert|7950|km2|abbr=on}}.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

While locals and tourist of the islands suffered the greatest casualties from the tsunami, most of the aboriginal people survived because oral traditions passed down from generations ago warned them to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] from large waves that follow large earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4181855.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tsunami folklore 'saved islanders' | date=20 January 2005 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Andaman.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Andaman Islands.]]
&lt;!--Geographic details such as number of islands are as per Govt of India Planning Commission Report. Do not change without discussion on talk page.--&gt;There are 572 [[islands]] in the territory having an area of {{convert|7950|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Of these, about 34 are permanently inhabited. The islands extend from 6° to 14° North latitudes and from 92° to 94° East longitudes. The Andamans are separated from the Nicobar group by a channel (the [[Ten Degree Channel]]) some {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} wide. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island ([[Saddle Peak (Andaman Islands)|Saddle Peak]] at {{convert|732|m|abbr=on}}). The Andaman group has 325 islands which cover an area of {{convert|6170|km2|0|abbr=on}} while the Nicobar group has only 24 islands with an area of {{convert|1765|km2|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33}}

The capital of the union territory, Port Blair, is located {{convert|1255|km|abbr=on}} from [[Kolkata]], {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from [[Visakhapatnam]] and {{convert|1190|km|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33}} The northernmost point of the Andaman and Nicobars group is {{convert|901|km|abbr=on}} away from the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]] and {{convert|190|km|abbr=on}} from Myanmar. Indira Point at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E at the southern tip of the southernmost island, Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point of India and lies only {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} from [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]]. The only volcano in [[India]], [[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]] is located in Andaman and Nicobar.

==Flora==
[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.

The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.

This atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:
# Giant [[evergreen forest]]
# Andamans tropical evergreen forest
# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]
# Cane brakes
# Wet bamboo brakes
# Andamans semi-evergreen forest
# Andamans moist deciduous forest
# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest
# [[Littoral]] forest
# [[Mangrove forest]]
# Brackish water mixed forest
# Submontane forest

==Fauna==

[[File:Rose island andaman.jpg|thumb|Rose island andaman]]
This tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.

About 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman Wild Boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''[[Sus scrofa andamanensis]]'' from Andaman and ''[[Sus scrofa nicobaricus]]'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State animal of andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.

About 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the Edible-nest Swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soup&quot;&gt;R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]''. Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History,Coimbatore, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory is home to about 225 species of [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, including some of the larger and most spectacular of the world. Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these Islands.

The islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].

There are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, 9 National Parks and 1 Biosphere Reserve in these islands &lt;ref&gt;India Year Book 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages of the islands.&lt;ref name=langoff/&gt; [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is the dominant and most spoken language, with 26% of the population speaking Bengali. The other major languages spoken in the islands are Hindi (18.23%), [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (17.68%), [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (12.81%), [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] (8.11%) and [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] (8.05%) according to 2001 Census of India.&lt;ref name=langoff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM50thReport.pdf |title= Report of the Commissioner for linguistic minorities: 50th report (July 2012 to June 2013) |publisher=Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities, Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India |page=142|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minor spoken languages are Kurukh/Oraon, Munda and Kharia. [[Andaman Creole Hindi]] is widely used as a trade language in the Andamans.

There remain approximately 400–450 indigenous Andamanese in the Andaman islands, the [[Jarawa people (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]] and [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]] in particular maintaining a steadfast independence and refusing most attempts at contact. In the Nicobar Islands, the indigenous people are the [[Nicobarese people|Nicobarese]], or ''Nicobari'', living throughout many of the islands, and the [[Shompen people|Shompen]], restricted to the hinterland of [[Great Nicobar]]. More than 2,000 people belonging to the [[Karen people|Karen]] tribe live in the [[Mayabunder]] tehsil of North Andaman district, almost all of whom are Christians. Despite their tribal origins, the Karen of Andamans have [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) status in the Andamans.

The majority of schools and educational institutions are available in [[Bengali language]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language]]s are used in few institutions.

The majority of people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are [[Hindus]] (69.44%), with [[Christian]]s forming a large minority of 21.7% of the population, according to the 2011 census of India. There are small but significant [[Muslim]] (8.51%) and [[Sikh]] minorities.

==Administration==
In 1874, the British had placed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in one administrative territory headed by a Chief Commissioner as its judicial administrator. On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of Lieutenant Governor was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration. Subsequently a &quot;Pradesh council&quot; with Counselors as representatives of the people was constituted to advise the Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;/&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is divided into three districts. Each district is further divided into sub-divisions and [[taluk]]s:

===Agriculture===
A total of {{convert|48675|ha}} of land is used for agriculture purposes. [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|Paddy]], the main food crop, is mostly cultivated in Andaman group of islands, whereas coconut and [[arecanut]] are the cash crops of Nicobar group of islands. Field crops, namely [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]] and vegetables are grown, followed by [[Rice|paddy]] during [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] season. Different kinds of fruits such as [[mango]], [[sapota]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[banana]], [[papaya]], pineapple and [[root crops]] are grown on hilly land owned by farmers. Spices such as pepper, [[clove]], [[nutmeg]], and [[cinnamon]] are grown under a multi-tier cropping system. [[Rubber]], [[red oil]], [[Palm (plant)|palm]], [[noni]] and [[cashew]] are grown on a limited scale in these islands.

===Industry===
There are 1,374 registered small-scale, village and handicrafts units. Two units are export-oriented in the line of fish processing activity. Apart from this, there are shell and wood based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, PVC conduit pipes and fittings, paints and varnished, fibre glass and mini flour mills, soft drinks and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation has spread its wings in the field of tourism, fisheries, industries and industrial financing and functions as authorised agents for [[Air India Regional|Alliance Air]]/[[Jet Airways]]. The Islands have become a tourist destination, due to the draw of their largely unspoiled virgin beaches and waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andaman and Nicobar Islands – Unexplored Beauty of India |url=http://www.indianbackpacker.com/index.php/india/islands/andaman-and-nicobar-islands-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-unexplored-beauty-of-india |accessdate=2 January 2013 |newspaper=The Indian Backpacker |date=December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121221184850/http://indianbackpacker.com/index.php/india/islands/andaman-and-nicobar-islands-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-unexplored-beauty-of-india |archivedate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism in Andaman and Nicobar Islands}}
Andaman and Nicobar Islands are developing into a major tourism hub with exotic-looking beaches and pristine islands having equally exotic names, wonderful opportunities for adventure sports like snorkeling and sea-walking.&lt;ref name=bp1 /&gt;
[[File:A statue of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] at [[Cellular Jail]].]]

In Port Blair, the main places to visit are the Cellular Jail, Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Andaman Water sports complex, Chatham Saw Mill, Mini Zoo, Corbyn's cove, Chidiya Tapu, Wandoor Beach, Forest Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Museum, Naval Museum (Samudrika), Ross Island and Viper Island. Other places include Havelock island famous for Radhanagar Beach, Neil Island for Scuba diving/snorkelling, Cinque island, Saddle peak, Mt Harriet and Mud Volcano. The southern group (Nicobar islands) is mostly inaccessible to tourists.

Indian tourists do not require a permit to visit the Andaman islands but if they wish to visit any tribal areas they need a special permit from the Deputy Commissioner, Port Blair. Permits are required for foreign nationals. For foreign nationals arriving by air, these are granted upon arrival at Port Blair.

According to official estimates, the flow of tourists doubled to nearly 300,000 in 2012 from 130,000 in 2008-09. The Radha Nagar beach of Andamans was chosen as Asia’s best Beach in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;bp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How Andaman &amp; Nicobar can fully capitalize its Tourism Potential?|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/how-andaman-nicobar-can-fully-capitalize-its-tourist-potential/ |work=IANS |publisher=news.biharprabha.com |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sisters (Andaman)==
The Sisters is small uninhabited islands in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about {{convert|6|km|nmi|abbr=on}} southeast of Passage Island and {{convert|18|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north of North Brother:
East Sister Island (Andaman)
West Sister Island (Andaman)
The islands are about 250 m apart, connected by a coral reef. They are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the NW side of East Sister. They belong to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Territory of India.

Before the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sister islands were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. They may have been a waystation for their temporary settlement of Rutland Island between 1890 and 1930.
The islands have been a wildlife refuge since 1987, with 0.36 km2 of area.

The '''Malay Archipelago'''  ({{lang-ms|Kepulauan Melayu}}, {{lang-id|Kepulauan Melayu or Nusantara}}, {{lang-fil|Kapuluang Malay}}) is the [[archipelago]] between mainland [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. It has also been called the '''Malay World''', '''Indo-Australian Archipelago''', '''East Indies''', '''Nusantara''', '''Spices Archipelago,''' and other names over time. The name was taken from the 19th-century European concept of a [[Malay race]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace1869&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wallace  | first = Alfred Russel  | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace | title = The Malay Archipelago | publisher = Macmillan and Co  | year = 1869  | location = London  | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Wallace uses the term, the 'Malay race,' but does not say it was anachronistic.--&gt;

Situated between the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, the group of over 25,000 [[island]]s is the largest archipelago by area, and fourth by [[List of archipelagos by number of islands|number of islands]] in the [[world]]. It includes [[Brunei]], [[East Malaysia]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name= Britannica&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  2006.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[New Guinea]] is usually excluded from definitions of the Malay Archipelago, although the Indonesian western portion of the island may be included.&lt;ref name= Britannica/&gt; The term is largely synonymous with [[maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name= Worldworx&gt;&quot;[http://www.worldworx.tv/regional-information/asia/maritime-southeast-asia/index.htm Maritime Southeast Asia].&quot; ''Worldworx Travel''.  Accessed 26 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and terminology ==
The term was derived from the European concept of a [[Malay race]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace1869&quot; /&gt; which referred to the people who inhabited what is now [[Brunei]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] (excluding [[West Papua (region)|Western New Guinea]]), [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]. The racial concept was proposed by [[Europe]]an explorers based on their observations of the influence of the [[ethnic Malays|ethnic Malay]] empire, [[Srivijaya]], which was based on the island of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Anthony. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2067345_ITM ''Understanding Melayu (Malay) as a Source of Diverse Modern Identities. Origins of Malayness''], Cambridge University Press, 2001. Retrieved on March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Alfred Wallace]] used the term &quot;Malay Archipelago&quot; as the title of [[The Malay Archipelago|his influential book]] documenting his studies in the region. Wallace also referred to the area as the &quot;Indian Archipelago&quot; and the &quot;Indo-Australian&quot; Archipelago.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago |url=http://web2.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S078.htm |year=1863
|accessdate=30 November 2009}}; {{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Alfred Russel | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace | title = The Malay Archipelago | publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1869 | location = London | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He included within the region the [[Solomon Islands]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] due to physiographic similarities.&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt; As Wallace noted,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/wallace/race.html
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If we draw a line ... commencing along the western coast of Gilolo, through the island of Bouru, and curving round the west end of Mores, then bending back by Sandalwood Island to take in Rotti, we shall divide the Archipelago into two portions, the races of which have strongly marked distinctive peculiarities. This line will separate the Malayan and all the Asiatic races, from the Papuans and all that inhabit the Pacific; and though along the line of junction intermigration and commixture have taken place, yet the division is on the whole almost as well defined and strongly contrasted, as is the corresponding zoological division of the Archipelago, into an Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan region.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; there are arguments for excluding [[Papua New Guinea]] for cultural and geographical reasons: Papua New Guinea is culturally quite different from the other countries in the region, and the island of [[New Guinea]] is geologically not part of the continent of [[Asia]], as the islands of the [[Sunda Shelf]] are (see [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]).

The archipelago was called the &quot;[[Indies|East Indies]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED first edition]] ''A geographical term, including Hindostan, Further India, and the islands beyond'' with first found usage 1598&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 16th century and throughout the European colonial era. It is still sometimes referred to as such,&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; but broader usages of the &quot;East Indies&quot; term had included [[mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The area is called &quot;[[Nusantara]]&quot; in the [[Indonesian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Other high mountains in the archipelago include [[Puncak Mandala]], Indonesia at {{convert|4760|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Puncak Trikora]], Indonesia, at {{convert|4750|m|0|abbr=on}}.

The climate throughout the archipelago is tropical, owing to its position on the [[equator]].

=== Biogeography ===
[[File:Línea de Wallace.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Wallace's line]] between Australian and Southeast Asian fauna. The deep water of the Lombok Strait between the islands of Bali and Lombok formed a water barrier even when lower sea levels linked the now-separated islands and landmasses on either side.]]

Wallace used the term [[The Malay Archipelago|''Malay Archipelago'']] as the title of his influential book documenting his studies in the region. He proposed what would come to be known as the &quot;[[Wallace Line]]&quot;, a boundary that separated the flora and fauna of Asia and Australia. The ice age boundary was formed by the deep water straits between [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]]; and through the [[Lombok Strait]] between [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]. This is now considered the western border of the [[Wallacea]] transition zone between the [[Ecozone|zoogeographical regions]] of Asia and Australia. The zone has a mixture of species of Asian and Australian origin, and its own endemic species.

== Demography ==
{{See also|Demographics of Southeast Asia}}

Over 380 million people live in the region, with the most populated island being [[Java (island)|Java]]. The people living there are predominantly from [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] subgroupings and correspondingly speak western [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]. The main religions in this region are [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and traditional [[animism]].

Culturally, the region is often seen{{Who|date=June 2011}} as part of &quot;Farther India&quot; or [[Greater India]]—the Coedes ''Indianized states of Southeast Asia'' refers to it as &quot;Island Southeast Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coedes, G.

[[File:Andaman nicobar 76.jpg|thumb|Detailed map of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]

The '''Andaman Islands''' (अंडमान द्वीप) form an [[archipelago]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] between [[India]], to the west, and [[Myanmar]], to the north and east. Most are part of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] [[Union Territory]] of India, while a small number in the north of the archipelago, including the [[Coco Islands]], belong to Myanmar.

The Andaman Islands are home to the only known [[Paleolithic|paleolithic people]], the [[Sentinelese people]], who have had no contact with any other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.and.nic.in/archives/andaman/tribes.php|title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Administration|work=and.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Andamanese comparative distribution.png|thumb|Comparative distributions of Andamanese indigenous peoples, pre-18C vs present-day]]


===Etymology===

The name of the Andaman Islands is ancient. A theory that became prevalent in the late 19th century is that it derives from Andoman, a form of [[Hanuman]], the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of the [[Hinduism|Indian]] God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Temple|first=R. C.|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series: Andaman and Nicobar Islands|edition=1996|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=New Delhi|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_47kfxz4ogC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120608764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hunter1908&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Imperial Gazetteer of India |author1=William Wilson Hunter |author2=James Sutherland Cotton |author3=Richard Burn |author4=William Stevenson Meyer | publisher=Great Britain India Office, Clarendon Press | year=1908 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/?id=TgC2AAAAIAAJ | quote=''...&amp;nbsp;The name has always been in historical times some form of Andaman, which more than probably represents Handuman, the Malay from Hanuman.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another Italian traveler, [[Niccolò de' Conti]] (c. 1440), mentioned the islands and said that the name means &quot;Island of Gold&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}


===Early inhabitants===
The Andaman islands have been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from [[genetics|genetic]], [[culture|cultural]] and isolation studies suggests that the islands may have been inhabited as early as the [[Middle Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Palanichamy, Malliya G. Suraksha Agrawal, Yong-Gang Yao, Qing-Peng Kong, Chang Sun, Faisal Khan, Tapas Kumar Chaudhuri, and Ya-Ping Zhang. 2006. Comment on &quot;Reconstructing the Origin of Andaman Islanders. ''Science'' 311:470 (27 January 2006). Andamanese, Tamil and Malayalam are the major languages spoken here.&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous [[Andamanese people]] appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century CE.

The Andamans are theorized to be a key stepping stone in a [[Great Coastal Migration|great coastal migration]] of humans from [[Africa]] via the [[Arabian peninsula]], along the coastal regions of the Indian mainland and towards [[Southeast Asia]], [[Japan]] and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wells2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey | author=Spencer Wells | year=2002 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=0-691-11532-X | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC | quote=''...&amp;nbsp;the population of south-east Asia prior to 6000 years ago was composed largely of groups of hunter-gatherers very similar to modern Negritos ...

===Chola empire===
From 800 to 1200 CE, the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Chola dynasty]] created an empire that eventually extended from southeastern peninsular India to parts of [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bingham1964&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=A History of Asia |author1=Woodbridge Bingham |author2=Hilary Conroy |author3=Frank William Iklé | publisher=Allyn and Bacon | year=1964 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/?id=r2ILAAAAIAAJ | quote=''...&amp;nbsp;Maldives, Nicobar, and Andaman islands all were brought under the sway of its navy.

===Maratha empire===
The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] admiral [[Kanhoji Angre]] used the Andamans as a base and &quot;fought the British off these islands until his death in 1729.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Andaman Islands, India  |author =Olivier Blaise | publisher=PictureTank | url=http://www.picturetank.com/___/series/ff5d5b4d962b08bc130471b877292c58/en/Andaman_Isl.,_India_(1).html | quote=''...&amp;nbsp;Kanhoji Angre, a Maratha admiral had his base on the island in the early 18th century.

=== British colonization and penal colony ===

In 1789, the government of [[Bengal]] established a naval base and [[penal colony]] on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of [[South Andaman Island|Great Andaman]]. The settlement is now known as [[Port Blair]] (after the [[Bombay Marine]] lieutenant [[Archibald Blair]] who founded it). After two years, the colony was moved to the northeast part of [[North Andaman Island|Great Andaman]] and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral [[William Cornwallis]]. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot; /&gt;

In 1824, Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the [[First Burmese War]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives and the islands had a reputation for cannibalism. The loss of the ''Runnymede'' and the ''Briton'' in 1844 during the same storm, while transporting goods and passengers between India and Australia, and the continuous attacks launched by the natives, which the survivors fought off, alarmed the British government.&lt;ref&gt;'Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea'  W.H.G. Kingston. George Routledge and Sons, London. 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labor, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.

May 17, 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The &quot;Battle of Aberdeen&quot; was fought between the Great Andamanese Tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman Water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their life. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the great Andamanese tribe stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapidiq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rapidiq.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/the-rise-and-the-fall-of-the-great-andamanese/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Andamanese|work=Confessions of a Linguist!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the ship ''Nineveh'' wrecked on the reef of [[North Sentinel Island]]. The 86 survivors reached the beach in the ship's boats. On the third day, they were attacked with iron-tipped spears by naked islanders. One person from the ship escaped in a boat and the others were later rescued by a British Royal Navy ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodheart&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28578579_ITM | work=American Scholar | title=The Last Island of the Savages | date=22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, sickness and mortality were high, but [[Land reclamation|swamp reclamation]] and extensive forest clearance continued. The Andaman colony became notorious with the murder of the Viceroy [[Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo]], on a visit to the settlement (8 February 1872), by a Muslim convict, a [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] from [[Afghanistan]], Sher Ali. In the same year, the two island groups Andaman and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]], were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair.

[[File:Port Blair 1872 Ross Island Penal HQ.jpg|thumb|right|The Ross Island prison headquarters, 1872]]
From the time of its development in 1858 under the direction of James Pattison Walker, and in response to the mutiny and rebellion of the previous year, the settlement was first and foremost a repository for [[political prisoner]]s. The [[Cellular Jail]] at Port Blair when completed in 1910 included 698 cells designed for solitary confinement; each cell measured {{convert|4.5|by|2.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with a single ventilation window {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} above the floor. A notable prisoner there was [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]].

The Indians imprisoned here referred to the Island and its prison as ''Kala Pani'' (&quot;black water&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/History.htm |title=History of Andaman Cellular Jail |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1996 film set on the island took that term as its title ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0255289/ |title=Kala Pani (1996) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prisoners who died in this camp is estimated to be in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/ListOfRevolutionaries.htm |title=Andaman Islands Political Prisoners |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more died of harsh treatment and the harsh living and working conditions in this camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/21/stories/2005122107881100.htm |title=Opinion / News Analysis: Hundred years of the Andamans Cellular Jail |publisher=The Hindu |date= 21 December 2005|accessdate=14 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511175419/http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/21/stories/2005122107881100.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viper Chain Gang Jail on [[Viper Island]] was reserved for troublemakers, and was also the site of hangings. In the 20th century, it became a convenient place to house prominent members of India's independence movement.

====Japanese occupation====
[[File:Andaman ross is.jpg|thumb|[[Ross Island (Andaman)|Ross Island]] in 2004]]
[[File:Andaman.jpg|thumb|Andaman Islands]]
The Andaman and Nicobar islands were [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands|occupied by Japan]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Klemen|last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/andaman.html |title= The capture of the Andaman Islands, March 1942 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were nominally put under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind]] (Provisional Government of Free India) headed by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], who visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as [[Shahid|Shaheed]] (Martyr) &amp; Swaraj (Self-rule). On 30 December 1943, during the Japanese occupation, Bose, who was allied with the Japanese, first raised the flag of Indian independence. General [[A. D. Loganathan|Loganathan]], of the [[Indian National Army]], was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been annexed to the Provisional Government. According to Werner Gruhl: &quot;Before leaving the islands, the Japanese rounded up and [[Japanese war crimes|executed 750 innocents]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Gruhl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&amp;pg=PA102 Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945]'', Transaction Publishers, 2007 ISBN 978-0-7658-0352-8&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war the islands returned to British control before becoming part of the newly independent state of India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

At the close of World War II, the British government announced its intention to abolish the penal settlement. The government proposed to employ former inmates in an initiative to develop the island's fisheries, timber, and agricultural resources. In exchange, inmates would be granted return passage to the Indian mainland, or the right to settle on the islands. The penal colony was eventually closed on 15 August 1947 when India gained independence. It has since served as a museum to the independence movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Recent history===
In April 1998, American photographer John S Callahan organized the first surfing project in the Andamans, starting from [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] in Thailand with the assistance of Southeast Asia Liveaboards (SEAL), a UK owned dive charter company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} With a crew of international professional surfers, they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht ''Crescent'' and cleared formalities in Port Blair. The group proceeded to Little Andaman Island, where they spent ten days surfing several spots for the first time, including Jarawa Point near Hut Bay and the long right reef point at the southwest tip of the island, named Kumari Point. The resulting article in ''Surfer Magazine'', &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; by journalist Sam George, put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =surfermag |url=http://www.surfermag.com/magazine/archivedissues/quest-for-fire |title=SURFER Explores The Andaman Islands &amp;#124; SURFER Magazine |publisher=Surfermag.com |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the waves of the Andaman Islands also appeared in the film ''Thicker than Water'', shot by cinematographer [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], who later achieved worldwide fame as a popular musician.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans, including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a {{convert|10|m|ft|0|sing=on}} high tsunami following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Strong oral traditions in the area warned of the importance of moving inland after a quake and is credited with saving many lives. In the aftermath, more than 2,000 people were confirmed dead and more than 4,000 children were orphaned or had lost one parent. At least 40,000 residents were rendered homeless and were moved to relief camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sumatra-Andaman Islands Earthquake and Tsunami of December 26, 2004|year=2007|publisher=ASCE, Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784409510|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5511|editor1=Carl Strand |editor2=John Masek }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August 2009, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands, causing a tsunami warning to go into effect. On 30 March 2010, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands.

The subsoil of the Andaman islands consists essentially of [[Late Jurassic]] to [[Early Eocene]] [[ophiolite]]s and [[sedimentary rock]]s ([[argillaceous limestone|argillaceous]] and [[algal limestone]]s), deformed by numerous deep [[fault (geology)|faults]] and [[thrust fault|thrust]]s with [[ultramafic]] igneous [[intrusion (geology)|intrusion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsu&quot;/&gt;  There are at least 11 [[mud volcano]]es on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsu&quot;&gt;P.Chakrabarti, A. Nag, S. B. Dutta, S Dasgupta, N. Gupta (2006) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gEBfvCBclUC&amp;pg=PA42 S &amp; T Input: Earthquake and Tsunami Effects...]'', page 43. Chapter 5 in S. M. Ramasamy et al. (eds.), ''Geomatics in Tsunami'', New India Publishing. ISBN 81-89422-31-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is typical of tropical islands of similar latitude. It is always warm, but with sea-breezes. Rainfall is irregular, usually dry during the north-east, and very wet during the south-west, monsoons.

==Flora==
The Middle Andamans harbour mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterized by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers.

The natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest, with [[mangrove]]s on the coast. The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma. Most of the forests are evergreen, but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, [[Middle Andaman Island|Middle Andaman]], [[Baratang]] and parts of [[South Andaman Island]]. The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids.

The Andaman forests are largely unspoiled, despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on [[Little Andaman Island|Little Andaman]], [[Narcondam Island|Narcondam]], North Andaman and South Andaman, but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0101 |name=Andaman Islands rain forests|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of [[Interview Island]] and North Andaman.

===Timber===
[[File:Timber.JPG|thumb]]
Andaman forests contain 200 or more timber producing species of trees, out of which about 30 varieties are considered to be commercial. Major commercial timber species are Gurjan (''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' spp.) and [[Padauk]] (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]''). The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation:

* Marble Wood (''[[Diospyros|Diospyros marmorata]]'')
* Padauk (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]'')
* Silver Grey (a special formation of wood in white [[utkarsh]])
* Chooi (''[[Sageraea|Sageraea elliptica]]'')
* Kokko (''[[Albizzia lebbeck]]'')

Padauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making.

There are [[burr wood]] and [[buttress root]] formations in Andaman Padauk. The largest piece of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of {{convert|13|x|7|ft|abbr=on}}. The largest piece of burr wood was again a dining table for eight.

The holy [[Rudraksha]] (''Elaeocarps sphaericus'') and aromatic Dhoop resin trees also are found here.

==Fauna==
The Andaman Islands are home to a number of animals, many of them endemic.

===Mammals===
The island's endemic mammals include
* [[Andaman spiny shrew]] (''Crocidura hispida'')
* [[Andaman shrew]] (''Crocidura andamanensis'')
* [[Jenkins' shrew]] (''Crocidura jenkinsi'')
* [[Andaman horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus cognatus'')
* [[Andaman rat]] (''Rattus stoicus'')

The [[banded pig]] (''Sus scrofa vittatus''), also known as the Andaman wild boar and once thought to be an endemic subspecies,&lt;ref name=&quot;SrinivasuluSrinivasulu2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = South Asian Mammals: Their Diversity, Distribution, and Status | last1 = Srinivasulu | first1 = C. | last2 = Srinivasulu | first2 = B. | publisher = Springer | year = 2012 | page = 353 | isbn = 9781461434498}}&lt;/ref&gt; is protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). The [[spotted deer]] (''Axis axis''), the [[Indian muntjac]] (''Muntiacus muntjak'') and the [[sambar deer|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') were all introduced to the Andaman islands, though the sambar did not survive.

[[Interview Island]] (the largest wildlife sanctuary in the territory) in Middle Andaman holds a population of feral [[elephant]]s, which were brought in for forest work by a timber company and released when the company went bankrupt. This population has been subject to research studies.

===Birds===
Endemic or near endemic birds include
* ''[[Spilornis elgini]]'', a serpent-eagle
* ''[[Rallina canningi]]'', a crake (endemic; data-deficient per IUCN 2000)
* ''[[Columba palumboides]]'', a wood-pigeon
* ''[[Macropygia rufipennis]]'', a cuckoo dove
* ''[[Centropus andamanensis]]'', a subspecies of brown coucal (endemic)
* ''[[Otus balli]]'', the scops owl
* ''[[Ninox affinis]]'', a hawk-owl
* ''[[Aceros narcondami]]'', the Narcondam hornbill
* ''[[Dryocopus hodgei]]'', a woodpecker
* ''[[Dicrurus andamanensis]]'', a drongo
* ''[[Dendrocitta bayleyi]]'', a treepie
* ''[[Sturnus erythropygius]]'', the white-headed starling
* ''[[Collocalia esculenta]]'', the glossy swiftlet
* ''[[Aerodramus fuciphagus]]'', the edible-nest swiftlet
The islands' many [[caves]], such as those at [[Chalis Ek Caves|Chalis Ek]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest [[swiftlet]], whose nests are prized in China for [[bird's nest soup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soup&quot;&gt;R. Sankaran (1998), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]''. Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History,Coimbatore, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reptiles and amphibians===
The islands also have a number of endemic [[reptile]]s, [[toad]]s and [[frog]]s, such as the South Andaman krait (''[[Bungarus andamanensis]]'') and Andaman water monitor (''[[Varanus salvator andamanensis]]'').

There is a sanctuary {{convert|45|mi}} from [[Havelock Island]] for [[saltwater crocodile]]s. Over the past 25 years there have been 24 crocodile attacks with four fatalities, including the death of American tourist Lauren Failla. The government has been criticized for failing to inform tourists of the crocodile sanctuary and danger, while simultaneously promoting tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =David Knowles Writer |url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/crocodile-kills-nj-woman-lauren-failla-snorkeling-in-indian-ocean/19467474?icid=main%7Chtmlws-main-n%7Cdl1%7Clink6%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fnation%2Farticle%2Fcrocodile-kills-nj-woman-lauren-failla-snorkeling-in-indian-ocean%2F19467474 |title=Crocodile Kills NJ Woman Lauren Failla Snorkeling in Indian Ocean |publisher=AOL News |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crocodiles are not only found within the sanctuary, but throughout the island chain in varying densities. They are habitat restricted, so the population is stable but not large. Populations occur throughout available mangrove habitat on all major islands, including a few creeks on Havelock. The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries, thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean. It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around.

==Religion==
Most of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Animism]]. The tribal people of these islands believe that Paluga is the only deity and is responsible for everything happening on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJaAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22paluga%22+andaman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FRkf_1sLmt&amp;sig=mihRUmL-yMg35-wexlnF62hVToo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6GTbUq6rLJTEsASztoH4Ag&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22paluga%22&amp;f=false |title=The Andaman Islanders - A.

The faith of the Andamanese teaches that Paluga resides on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' [[Saddle Peak (Andaman Islands)]]. People try to avoid any action that might displease Paluga. People belonging to this religion believe in the presence of souls, ghosts, and spirits. 
Interestingly, people of this religion put a lot of emphasis on dreams. They let dreams decide different courses of action in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PEOPLE of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|url = http://www.webindia123.com/territories/andaman/people/intro.htm|website = Webindia123.com|access-date = 2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions practiced in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are, in terms of size, [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Demographics==
[[File:A young Onge mother with her baby.jpg|thumb|200px|A young Onge mother with her child]]
{{As of|2011}}, the population of the Andaman was 343,125,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_andaman.php |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100619045535/http://www.india.gov.in:80/knowindia/ut_andaman.php |archivedate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having grown from 50,000 in 1960. The bulk of the population originates from immigrants who came to the island since the colonial times, mainly of [[Bengali people|Bengali]], [[Hindustani people|Hindustani]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;distadmin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andamandt.nic.in/profile.htm |title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands at a glance |publisher=Andamandt.nic.in |date= |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Andamanese===
{{Main|Andamanese people}}

Of the people who live in the Andaman Islands, a small minority of about 1,000 are the so-called [[Andamanese people|Andamanese]], the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal inhabitants]] ([[adivasi]]) of the islands. By the 1850s when they first came into sustained contact by outside groups, there were estimated 7,000 Adamanese, divided into the following major groups:
* [[Great Andamanese]]
* [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]]
* [[Jangil]] (or ''Rutland Jarawa'')
* [[Onge people|Onge]]
* [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]]

As the numbers of settlers from the mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary [[indentured labour]]ers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers in the face of punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases. Presently, there remain only approximately 400–450 indigenous Andamanese. The Jangil were soon extinct. The Great Andamanese were originally 10 distinct tribes with 5,000 people in total; most of the tribes are extinct, and the survivors, now just 52, speak mostly [[Hindi language|Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html Anosh Malekar, &quot;The case for a linguisitic survey,&quot; ''Infochange Media,'' 1 August 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people. Only the Jarawa and Sentinelese still maintain a steadfast independence and refuse most attempts at contact; their numbers are uncertain but estimated to be in the low hundreds.
[[File:Jarwa Tribes Andaman.jpg|thumb|Tribes of Andaman]]

==Government==
[[Port Blair]] is the chief community on the islands, and the administrative centre of the Union Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new [[Nicobar district]] in 1974).

==Cultural references==
The islands are prominently featured in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery, ''[[The Sign of the Four]],'' as well as in [[M. M. Kaye]]'s ''Death in the Andamans''. The magistrate in [[Lady Gregory]]'s play ''[[Spreading the News]]'' had formerly served in the islands. [[Marianne Wiggins]]' novel, John Dollar (1989), is set on one of the islands; the characters begin an expedition from Burma to celebrate King George's birthday and after an earthquake and tsunami it becomes a grim survival story. A principal character in the book ''[[Six Suspects (novel)|Six Suspects]]'' by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands. ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]'' (Malayalam) and ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' (Tamil), a 1996 Indian film by [[Priyadarshan]], depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the [[Cellular Jail]] in Port Blair. ''Island's End'' is a 2011 novel by [[Padma Venkatraman]] about the training of an indigenous shaman.

==Transportation==
The only commercial airport in the islands is [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] in [[Port Blair]], which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]] and [[Chennai]] and Delhi, [[Bengaluru]] and Bhubaneswar. The airport is under control of the [[Indian Navy]]. Only daylight operations are allowed. A small airstrip of approximately 1000 metres is located near the Eastern shore of North Andaman near [[Diglipur]].

Due to the length of the routes and the small number of airlines flying to the islands, fares have traditionally been relatively expensive, although cheaper for locals than visitors. Fares are high during peak seasons of spring and winter, but fares have been decreased over the time due to expansion of the civil aviation industry in India.

'''Brig''', officially '''Brig-Glis''' ({{lang-fr|Brigue-Glis}}, {{lang-it|Briga-Glis}}) is a municipality in the district of [[Brig (district)|Brig]] in the canton of [[Valais]] in [[Switzerland]].

The official language of Brig is (the Swiss variety of Standard) [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.

The current municipality was formed in 1972 through the merger of Brig (city), Brigerbad and Glis.&lt;ref name=Fusion&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office {{de icon}} accessed 19 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with other Alpine towns Brig-Glis engages in the [[Alpine Town of the Year]] Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. 
Brig-Glis was awarded Alpine Town of the Year 2008.

==History==
The name Brig is derived from ''Briva'', or &quot;bridge.&quot;  Its older houses are very Italian in appearance, while its most prominent buildings ([[Stockalper Palace]], former Jesuits' college and Ursuline convent) all date from the 17th century, and are due to the generosity of a single member of the local Stockalper family, the [[baron]] [[Kaspar Jodok von Stockalper]].

The prosperity of Brig is bound up with the Simplon Pass, so that it gradually supplanted the more ancient village of [[Naters]] opposite, becoming a separate parish (the church is at Glis, a few minutes from the town) in 1517. Its medieval name was ''Briga dives''. The opening of the carriage road across the Simplon (1807) and of the tunnel beneath the pass (1906), as well as the fact that above Brig is the steeper and less fertile portion of the Upper Valais (then much frequented by tourists), greatly increased the importance and size of the town.

===Brig===
Brig is first mentioned in 1215 as ''Briga''. The first evidence of human habitation near Brig comes from a few [[Bronze Age]] objects, a bracelet and a dagger. The area remained inhabited through the [[La Tène culture|Latène era]] with scattered [[Walser]] settlements. During the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] the Roman influence was strongest along the [[Roman road]] on the valley floor. The area remained settled during the [[Iron Age]], [[Migration Period]] and [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig&gt;{{HDS|2662|Brig (city)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Briga family is first mentioned in 1215. The family was probably a branch of the Mangoldi line which was first mentioned in 1181 and is probably identical to the de Curia (im Hof) family which appeared between 1308-35. The family seat was the ''Höllenburg'', which was a tower above Brig. By the 17th Century the tower had been demolished. It is likely that the city was founded by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Bishop of Sion]], when they built a tower and curtain wall in the 12th century. The original tower was replaced with a new tower in the 13th Century, which was demolished in 1970.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;

In the 14th Century, Brig was first mentioned as a town. It grew in importance and in 1518 became the capital of the ''Zenden'' (a term for a district in Valais) of Brig. Together with the capital, it became the seat of the district court. The [[town hall]] is first mentioned in 1618. The city wall also served as a flood wall to help protect the town from the Saltina, which often flooded. The nearby [[Rhone]] caused floods in 1469, 1506, 1640, 1752, 1775, 1868 and 1920. In 1755 and again in 1855 an earthquake damaged the city. The [[Plague (disease)|plague]] decimated the population in 1465, 1475, 1485 and 1575. In 1799 French troops pillaged the city, burned the archives and inflicted great damage.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;

[[File:Kaspar Stockalper.jpg|thumb|upright|Kaspar Stockalper]]
Starting in the middle of the 13th Century, it was a storage, transshipment and customs station for transportation over the Simplon Pass. By the [[Early Modern Switzerland|early modern era]] a number of families were wealthy from trade and built palatial homes and public buildings in the city. The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] tower of the Provincial Governor Kaspar Metz Elten was built in 1526. Then, in 1658-78, Kaspar Jodok Stockalper built the [[Stockalper Palace]] with three towers, and arcaded courtyard and a park. The early modern city also featured the old Stockalper house (ca. 1533), the Salzhof (16th century, demolished 1967) which served as a transshipment and storage point, the patrician houses of Wegener (17th century), Mannhaft (1709) and Fernanda de Stockalper (1727). Outside the city, in 1677, Kaspar Jodok Stockalper built the Matteni manor house for Georg Christoph Mannhaft.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;

Brig originally belonged to the large [[parish]] of Naters until 1642 when it became part of the parish of Glis. Brig became its own parish in 1957 and built a [[parish church]] in 1967-70. In 1624-27, the [[Jesuits]] established a branch in the town. Between 1662-1773 and again in 1814-47, they ran a college in the town. The college was built in 1663-73 followed by the college church in 1673-87. Between 1773-1814 the college was administrated by the [[Piarists]]. Since 1848 it was operated by the Canton of Valais, and until 1990 the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] was a [[Catholic Laity|lay]] priest. The first [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery was built in 1650-60, but the existing monastery is from 1947-48. An [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] convent was founded in 1661 with a girls' school and the Ursuline Church dates from 1732. Since 1937 it has been the mission house (and sometimes a seminary) the Mariannhill Missionaries. The Anthony hospital was established in 1304. The [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] hospital church was built in the 14th century and the first hospital religious order was founded in 1399. It was later passed to the community, and served the town until 1908. The citizenry built the Sebastian Chapel in 1636-37 and restored it in 1972-73. In 1951, Karl Schmid built the Wehrmann chapel.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;
[[File:Bahnhof Brig MGB 31.07.2006.JPG|thumb|Train station of Brig]]
The construction of the new road over the Simplon Pass in 1801-05, the expansion of the old road between 1949–60 and the construction of a national highway starting in 1960, have allowed increasing traffic through Brig. In 1890-1905 stagecoaches transported 152,816 persons to [[Domodossola]] over the pass. In 1906 the first car drove over the Simplon. Since 1919, [[Postauto|postal buses]] have run over the pass into Brig. This service expanded from seasonal to year round in 1970. The first rail line into Brig was finished in 1874 and connected the town to the west by the Rhone Valley. The [[Lötschbergtunnel]], which opened in 1913, connected Brig to [[Bern]]. When the [[Simplon Tunnel]] was built in 1906 and the second tunnel was added in 1921, it provided a year round, reliable rail link with Italy. In 1926, the [[Furka–Oberalp-Bahn|Furka-Oberalp]] rail line connected Brig with [[Disentis]] in [[Graubünden]]. The railway station was built in 1877-78, and was expanded in 1910 with a new building, which also serves as a freight station and border station. The 1910 station was expanded in 1957, 1961 and 1993. In 1859 a telegraph office was built in town, followed by a local telephone network in 1898.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;

As it became easier to travel to Brig, the tourism industry grew. The number of hotel beds in town rose from 120 in 1800, to 425 in 1912 and to 1,000 in 1993. By 2002 the number of beds had dropped to about 820. In 1858 a large sawmill was built in town. This was followed by other smaller industrial companies, including woodworking, pasta production, telephone apparatus, gloves and knitwear. The Brig-Naters power plant was built in 1900 to supply power to the towns and their growing industry. However, in the middle to late 20th Century, most of the industrial plants left Brig. In 1990, 81% of the work force worked in the services or [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] of the economy. Only 18% worked in industry and 1% worked in agriculture. In 2001 there were 7,129 employees in Brig-Glis, working for 803 companies.&lt;ref name=HDS_Brig/&gt;

===Glis===
The oldest traces of human settlements around Glis were discovered in 1992 and included significant traces of settlements from the Bronze and Iron Ages. During the Middle Ages, Glis, Holz and Gamsen formed a municipality in the ''Zenden''. Starting around 1320, the settlement of Wickert (now part of Glis) was a farming estate that belonged to the [[collegiate church]] of [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]]. In the early 14th Century an earthen wall was built across the Rhône Valley at Gamsen. This wall, portions of which are still visible, was probably built to protect against invasions from [[Savoy]]. In 1596, an iron mine was opened near the village. This mine was acquired in 1636, by Kaspar Jodok Stockalper.&lt;ref name=HDS_Glis&gt;{{HDS|3302|Glis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1642, Glis belonged to the parish of Naters, but had been relatively independent in religious matters since the 12th-13th Century. The Church of Our Lady on the Glisacker has been a pilgrimage center of the Upper Valais since the 14th Century. Glis was raised to an independent parish in 1642. At that time, the parish included Brig, Brigerbad, Ried-Brig, Termen, Gamsen and Eggerberg. Excavations in and around the church in 1984 discovered an early Christian [[aisleless church]] from around 500. The excavations also discovered a baptistery and side rooms and parts of four other churches. The present church, which combines elements of both the Renaissance and the lateGothic period, owes its appearance to Prismell master builders Peter and Christian Bodmer. In the mid-17th Century they completed the plans drawn up in 1519 by Ulrich Ruffiner.&lt;ref name=HDS_Glis/&gt;

After the Second World War, Glis developed from a farming village into a residential area for Brig. In the merger with Brig, Glis brought a large amount of land and a large industrial company, the explosives factory ''Société suisse des explosifs'' which was founded in Gamsen in 1894.&lt;ref name=HDS_Glis/&gt;

===Brigerbad===
Very little is known about the early history of this small village located between the Rhone and the far north side of the valley. There are two buildings in the village that are from the Middle Ages: the tower of [[Junker]] von Baden, which may have been built in the 13th Century, and the so-called bishops barn, which may date from the 15th century. Brigerbad was always part of the parish of Glis, though they did build a chapel in 1721. The village began to develop local government and law in the 16th and 17th century and the first statutes were written in 1671. 

The floods of the Rhone, maintenance of Gamsner bridge (first mentioned in 1395) and the reclamation of the Eyen were commonplace activities from the 13th Century until the Rhone Correction in 1873-82. 

Brigerbad was known for its hot springs. The village's name literally means &quot;Brig's baths.&quot;  They were discovered in 1471 by Anton Walker and flourished in the 16th Century under Peter Owlig. The thermal hot spring baths began to decay in the 17th Century, but were rebuilt in 1934-35 and again in 1956-60.

'''Lyon''' or '''Lyons''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|l|iː|ˈ|ɒ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ɒ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Lyons?q=lyons Oxford Dictionary of English] (retrieved 2014-08-19)&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ljɔ̃|-|Fr-Lyon.ogg}}, &lt;small&gt;locally:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|lijɔ̃|}}; {{lang-frp|Liyon}} {{IPA-frp|ʎjɔ̃|}}) is a city in east-central [[France]], in the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]], situated between [[Paris]] and [[Marseille]]. The correct spelling in French is ''Lyon'', but the spelling ''Lyons'' is sometimes specified in English, particularly in newspaper [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-14/features/8702130575_1_lyons-spellings-english | title=What´s In A Name?

The residents of the city are called ''Lyonnais''.

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Lyon has a population of 500,715 (2013)&lt;ref name=&quot;commune&quot; /&gt; and is France's third-largest city after Paris and Marseille. Lyon is the seat of the [[metropolis of Lyon]], and the capital of both the [[Departments of France|department]] of  [[Rhône (department)|Rhône]] and the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]]. The greater [[metropolitan area]] of Lyon, a concept for statistical purposes that is not an administrative division, has a population of 2,214,068 (2012), which makes it the second-largest metropolitan area in France after [[Paris Metropolitan Area|Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AU10_pop&quot; /&gt;

The city is known for its historical and architectural landmarks and is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Lyon was historically known as an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Since the late 20th century, it has developed a reputation as a major center of [[French cuisine]] and an internationally significant [[gastronomy|gastronomical]] locale.

It has a significant role in the [[history of film|history of cinema]] due to [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], who invented the [[cinematographe]] in Lyon. The city is also known for its famous light festival, [[Fête des Lumières]], which occurs every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.

Economically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.greaterlyon.com/city-business-support-lyon-entrepreneurship-system.85.0.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Lyon entrepreneurship, Lyon company, Invest Lyon – Greater Lyon |publisher=Business.greaterlyon.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100308131020/http://www.business.greaterlyon.com:80/city-business-support-lyon-entrepreneurship-system.85.0.html?&amp;L=1 |archivedate=8 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon hosts the international headquarters of [[Interpol]], [[Euronews]], and [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Lyon|Timeline of Lyon}}
According to the historian [[Dio Cassius]], in 43 BC, the [[Roman Senate]] ordered [[Lucius Munatius Plancus|Munatius Plancus]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], lieutenants of the assassinated [[Julius Caesar]] and governors of central and [[Transalpine Gaul]], respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees. These refugees had been expelled from [[Vienne, Isere|Vienne]] (a town about {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} to the south) by the [[Allobroges]] and were now encamped at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers. Dio Cassius says this task was to keep the two men from joining [[Mark Antony]] and bringing their armies into the developing conflict. The Roman foundation was at [[Fourvière]] hill and was officially called ''Colonia Copia Felix Munatia'', a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as ''[[Lugdunum]]'' (and occasionally ''Lugudunum''&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 46: ''Lepidus and Lucius Plancus [...] founded the town called Lugudunum, now known as Lugdunum''&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louis|first1=Jaucourt de chevalier|title=Lyon|date=1765|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as &quot;Desired Mountain&quot; is offered by the 9th-century ''Endlicher Glossary''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lugduno – desiderato monte: dunum enim montem'' Lugduno: &quot;mountain of yearning&quot;; dunum of course is mountain. www.maryjones.us/ctexts/endlicher_glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] god [[Lugus]] ('Light', cognate with [[Irish language|Old Irish]] ''[[Lugh]]'', Modern Irish ''Lú''), and ''dúnon'' (hill-fort).

[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] recognized that Lugdunum's position on the natural highway from northern to south-eastern France made it a natural communications hub, and he made Lyon the starting point of the principal [[Roman roads]] throughout [[Gaul]]. It then became the capital of Gaul, partly due to its convenient location at the convergence of two navigable rivers, and quickly became the main city of Gaul. Two emperors were born in this city: [[Claudius]], whose speech is preserved in the [[Lyon Tablet]] in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic senators, and [[Caracalla]]. Today, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|archbishop of Lyon]] is still referred to as &quot;[[Primate (bishop)|''Primat des Gaules'']]&quot; and the city often referred to as the &quot;''capitale des Gaules''&quot;. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Septimius Severus|Septimus Severus]]. Local saints from this period include [[Blandina]] (Blandine), [[Saint Pothinus|Pothinus]] (Pothin), and [[Epipodius and Alexander|Epipodius]] (Épipode), among others. In the second century [[AD]], the great Christian bishop of Lyon was the Easterner [[Irenaeus]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Place Carnot, Lyons, France-LCCN2001698425.tif|thumb|Place Carnot, Lyon]]
[[Burgundians|Burgundian]] refugees fleeing the destruction of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] by the [[Huns]] in 437 were resettled by the military commander of the west, [[Flavius Aetius|Aëtius]], at [[Lugdunum]]. This became the capital of the new Burgundian kingdom in 461.

In 843, by the [[Treaty of Verdun]], Lyon, with the country beyond the [[Saône]], went to [[Lothair I]]. It later was made part of the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.

[[Fernand Braudel]] remarked, &quot;Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel 1984 p.&amp;nbsp;327&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 15th century, the [[fairs]] introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic [[counting house|countinghouse]] of France. (Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air.) When international banking moved to [[Genoa]], then [[Amsterdam]], Lyon remained the banking centre of France.

In 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant [[Huguenot]]s in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|St. Bartholomew's Day Massacres]].

During the [[French Revolution]], Lyon rose up against the [[National Convention]] and supported the [[Girondist|Girondins]]. In 1793, the city was assaulted by the Revolutionary armies and under siege for over two months before eventually surrendering. Several buildings were destroyed, especially around the [[Place Bellecour]]. [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Joseph Fouché]] administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. A decade later, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.

During the [[Renaissance]], the city's development was driven by the [[silk trade]], which strengthened its ties to Italy. (Italian influence on Lyon's architecture are still visible among historic buildings.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pierre Edmond DESVIGNES |url=http://www.vieux-lyon.org/lyon-epoque-renaissance_f01150.htm |title=Quartier renaissance Lyon : Vieux Lyon, quartier ancien et secteur sauvegarde Lyon |publisher=Vieux-lyon.org |date=|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the silk trade, the city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the ''[[canut]]s'' (silk workers) of Lyon staged [[canut revolts|two major uprisings]] for better working conditions and pay. The 1831 uprising had one of the first recorded uses of the [[Anarchist symbolism|black flag]] as an emblem of protest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1862, the world's first urban [[funicular]] railway was built between Lyon and [[La Croix-Rousse]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, as well as a stronghold of [[French Resistance|resistance]]. The ''[[traboule]]s'' (secret passages) through houses enabled the local people to escape [[Gestapo]] raids. On 3 September 1944, the city was liberated by the [[1st Free French Division]] and the [[Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur]]. The city is now home to a resistance museum.

==Geography==
The Rhône and Saône Rivers converge to the south of the historic city centre forming a peninsula or &quot;''[[Presqu'île (Lyon)|Presqu'île]]''&quot;. There are two large hills, one to the west and one to the north of the city centre, as well as a large plain which sprawls eastward. West of the Presqu'île, the original medieval city ([[Vieux Lyon]]) was built on the west bank of the Saône river at the foot of the [[Fourvière]] hill. This area, along with portions of the Presqu'île and much of the [[La Croix-Rousse|Croix-Rousse]] is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;/&gt;

To the west is Fourvière, known as &quot;the hill that prays&quot;. This is the location for the highly decorated [[basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]], several convents, the palace of the [[Archbishop]], the [[Metallic tower of Fourvière|Tour métallique]] (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the [[Eiffel Tower]]) and a [[funicular]] (a railway on a steep hill).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

To the north is the [[La Croix-Rousse|Croix-Rousse]], known as &quot;the hill that works&quot;. This area is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city was once renowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Georges Duby (ed), ''Histoire de la France : Dynasties et révolutions, de 1348 à 1852'' (vol. 2), [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 1999 p. 53 ISBN 2-03-505047-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Place Bellecour]] is located on the Presqu'île between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la République leads north from Place Bellecour. The second [[arrondissement]] has many of the finest old residential buildings in Lyon and the area is known for its concentration of old Lyonnaise Catholic families, {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} particularly in the Ainay part of the arrondissement.

East of the Rhône from the Presqu'île is a large area of flat ground upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population.
Situated in this area is the urban centre of [[La Part-Dieu|Part-Dieu]] which clusters the [[Tour du Crédit Lyonnais|Tour Part-Dieu]] (affectionately nicknamed &quot;The Pencil&quot;), the [[Tour Oxygène]], the [[Tour Swiss Life]], [[Lyon Part-Dieu|La Part-Dieu]] (a shopping centre), and [[Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu|Lyon Part-Dieu]] (one of Lyon's two major rail terminals).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

North of this district is the relatively wealthy sixth arrondissement, which is home to the [[Parc de la Tête d'Or]] (one of Europe's largest urban parks), the prestigious [[Lycée du Parc]] to the south of the park, and [[Interpol]]'s world headquarters on the park's western edge. The park contains a free zoo that has recently been upgraded.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Climate===
Lyon has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), albeit having some characteristics of the [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is {{convert|3.2|C|1}} in January and in the warmest month in July is {{convert|22|C|1}}, hence maintaining its [[subtropical]] classification. Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of {{convert|830|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but the winter months are the driest.

{{Main|Arrondissements of Lyon}}
[[File:Arrondissements de Lyon.svg|thumb|150px|Map of the City of Lyon divided into 9 [[Arrondissements of Lyon|arrondissements]]]]
[[File:Métropole de Lyon map-blank.svg|thumb|150px|Map of the [[Metropolis of Lyon]] (the city of Lyon is in red)]]

Like Paris and [[Marseille]], the city of Lyon is divided into a number of [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]], each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guillotière, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the [[Rhône]]) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'Île-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th – and, to date, final – arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable ''quartiers'' or neighbourhoods are:
*[[1st arrondissement of Lyon|1st arrondissement]]: Slopes of [[La Croix-Rousse]], [[Place des Terreaux|Terreaux]], Martinière/St-Vincent
*[[2nd arrondissement of Lyon|2nd arrondissement]]: Cordeliers, [[Place Bellecour|Bellecour]], Ainay, [[Perrache (quarter)|Perrache]], Confluent
*[[3rd arrondissement of Lyon|3rd arrondissement]]: Guillotière (north), Préfecture, [[La Part-Dieu|Part-Dieu]], Villette, Dauphiné/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)
*[[4th arrondissement of Lyon|4th arrondissement]]: Plateau de [[la Croix-Rousse]], Serin
*[[5th arrondissement of Lyon|5th arrondissement]]: [[Vieux Lyon]] ([[Saint-Paul (Lyon)|Saint-Paul]], Saint-Jean, [[Saint-Georges, Lyon|Saint-Georges]]), Saint-Just, Saint-Irénée, [[Fourvière]], Point du Jour, Ménival, Battières, Champvert (south)
*[[6th arrondissement of Lyon|6th arrondissement]]: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, [[Parc de la Tête d'Or]], Cité Internationale
*[[7th arrondissement of Lyon|7th arrondissement]]: Guillotière (south), Jean Macé, Gerland
*[[8th arrondissement of Lyon|8th arrondissement]]: Monplaisir (south), [[Le Bachut|Bachut]], États-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin à Vent, Grange Blanche (south), [[Laënnec]], Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine
*[[9th arrondissement of Lyon|9th arrondissement]]: [[Vaise]], Duchère, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'Île-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)

Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Saône and the Rhône, divide the arrondissements into three groups:
* To the west of the Saône, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvière hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of Écully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.
* Between the two rivers, on the [[Presqu'île (Lyon)|Presqu'île]] are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre, including Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers. The first is directly to the north of the second and covers part of the city centre (including the [[Hôtel de Ville, Lyon|Hôtel de Ville]]) and the slopes of La Croix-Rousse. To the north of the Boulevard is the fourth arrondissement, which covers the Plateau of La Croix-Rousse, up to its boundary with the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire.
* To the east of the Rhône, are the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth arrondissements.

Since the Middle Ages, the residents of the region speak several dialects of [[Arpitan language]]. The [[Lyonnais]] dialect was partly replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However, it is still alive and, in addition, some &quot;frenchified&quot; Franco-Provençal words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls &quot;gones&quot; and &quot;fenottes&quot; for example.&lt;ref name=Onofrio&gt;Jean-Baptiste Onofrio : ''Essai d'un glossaire des patois de Lyonnais, Forez et Beaujolais'', Lyon 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The [[Institut Lumière]], built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artefacts.
* 8 December each year is marked by the [[Festival of Lights (Lyon)|Festival of Lights]] (la Fête des lumières), a celebration of thanks to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (''lumignons'') at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cathédrale St-Jean.
* The church of [[Francis de Sales|Saint Francis of Sales]] is famous for its large and unaltered [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll|Cavaillé-Coll]] pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.
* The [[Opéra Nouvel]] (New Opera House) is the home of the [[Opéra National de Lyon]]. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.
* Lyon is also the French capital of &quot;''[[Trompe-l'œil|trompe l'œil]]''&quot; walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pa-muet.com/archives.htm |title=Pierre Alain Muet Archives 2008 |publisher=Pa-muet.com |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100124093221/http://pa-muet.com:80/archives.htm |archivedate=24 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brefonline.com/numeroERA_affichearticle.asp?idA=3262 |title=Bottazzi fait le mur |publisher=Brefonline.Com |date=|accessdate=5 February 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071125163711/http://www.brefonline.com/numeroERA_affichearticle.asp?idA=3262 |archivedate= 25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Brothers of the Sacred Heart]], a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.
* The [[African Museum of Lyon]] is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-africain-lyon.org/ |title=The African Museum of Lyon Website |publisher=Musee-africain-lyon.org |date=|accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various persons prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to [[Klaus Barbie]]. Lyon sees itself as the centre of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town centre. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.
* The unusual project [[Lyon Dubai City]], a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for the tourism in Lyon.
* Lyon is a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]] [[Intercultural cities]] programme.

===UNESCO World Heritage Site===

The Historic Site of Lyons was designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the &quot;exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Site of Lyons|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/872/|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific regions composing the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvière, the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'île, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyon.fr/vdl/sections/en/tourisme/copy_of_patrimoine/a_patrimoinemondial UNESCO World Heritage Site]. City of Lyon official website. Retrieved 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Both Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named ''[[traboule]]s'') that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perret|first1=Aurelie|title=Les traboules de Lyon|url=http://www.histoire-pour-tous.fr/tourisme/101-france-sud-est/5105-les-traboules-de-lyon.html|website=histoire-pour-tous.fr|publisher=SF Webmedia|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the [[Saône]] river quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.

===Gastronomy===
{{Main|Lyonnaise cuisine}}
Lyon has a long and storied culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic [[Curnonsky]] referred to the city as &quot;the gastronomic capital of the world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curnonsky, Marcel E. Grancher|title=Lyon, capitale mondiale de la gastronomie|date=1935|publisher=Editions Lugdunum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D481HQAACAAJ&amp;dq=curnonsky+lyon|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim repeated by later writers such as [[Bill Buford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/13/bill-buford-lyon-food-capital |title=Why Lyon is food capital of the world |author= Buford, Bill |work=The Guardian |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as [[Marie Bourgeois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priay Il y a 80 ans &quot; La mère Bourgeois &quot; obtenait 3 étoiles|url=http://www.leprogres.fr/ain/2013/01/09/priay-il-y-a-80-ans-la-mere-bourgeois-obtenait-3-etoiles|website=leprogres.fr|publisher=Le Progres|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugénie Brazier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histoire de la gastronomie 2/4 |url=http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-la-fabrique-de-l-histoire-histoire-de-la-gastronomie-24-2010-11-23.html |website=franceculture.fr |publisher=Radio France |accessdate=30 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140107011217/http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-la-fabrique-de-l-histoire-histoire-de-la-gastronomie-24-2010-11-23.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favored by the French elite; a tradition which [[Paul Bocuse]] later turned into a world-wide success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaudry|first1=François-Régis|title=Paul Bocuse: derniers secrets du &quot;pape&quot; de la gastronomie française|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/paul-bocuse-derniers-secrets_1578426.html|website=lexpress.fr|publisher=Groupe Express-Roularta|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[bouchon]]&quot; is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local dishes such as sausages, duck pâté or roast pork; along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the [[Beaujolais (wine)|Beaujolais]] region to the north and the [[Côtes du Rhône AOC|Côtes du Rhône]] region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of [[brunch]] food called &quot;mâchons&quot;, made of local [[charcuterie]] and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine.  Mâchons were the customary meal of the [[canut]]s, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuisine et boissons Lyon et ses environs|url=http://www.routard.com/guide/lyon/372/cuisine_et_boissons.htm|website=routard.com|publisher=Cyberterre / Hachette tourisme|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other traditional local dishes include [[Rosette de Lyon|Rosette lyonnaise]] and saucisson de Lyon (sausage); [[andouillette]] (a sausage of coarsely cut tripe); pistachio sausage; [[coq au vin]]; [[quenelle|esox (pike) quenelle]]; gras double ([[tripe]] cooked with onions); [[salade lyonnaise]] (lettuce with bacon, croûtons and a poached egg); [[marron glacé|marrons glacés]]; [[coussin de Lyon]], [[sabodet]] and [[cardoon]] au gratin. [[Cervelle de canut]] (lit. silk worker's brains) is a cheese spread/dip, another Lyonnais speciality. The dish has a base of [[fromage frais|fromage blanc]], seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.

===Sport===
[[File:RWC-2007-AUSvsJAP.JPG|left|thumb|[[Stade de Gerland]]]]
Lyon is home to the [[Ligue 1]] [[Association football|football]] team [[Olympique Lyonnais]], a seven-time winner of the French first division championship (2002–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avant d’être une compétition, le Trophée des champions est une vitrine pour la Ligue 1|url=http://webfootballclub.fr/avant-detre-une-competition-le-trophee-des-champions-est-une-vitrine-pour-la-ligue-1-8274|website=webfootballclub.fr|publisher=Web Football Club|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat [[Stade de Gerland]], which also hosted matches of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].  Since 2016, the team plays at the [[Parc Olympique Lyonnais]], a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of [[Décines-Charpieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joly|first1=Maxime|title=Le Grand Stade de Lyon pourrait rapporter 70 millions d'euros par an à l'OL|url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/le-scan-sport/business/2015/03/27/27004-20150327ARTFIG00142-le-grand-stade-de-lyon-pourrait-rapporter-70-millions-d-euros-par-an-a-l-ol.php|website=lefigaro.fr|publisher=Le Figaro|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyon has a [[rugby union]] team, [[Lyon OU]], currently in [[Rugby Pro D2|Pro D2]]. In addition, Lyon has a [[rugby league]] side called [[Lyon Villeurbanne]] that plays in the [[French Rugby League Championship|French rugby league championship]]. The club's current home is the [[Stade Georges Lyvet]] in Villeurbanne.

Lyon is also home to the [[Lyon Hockey Club]], an [[ice hockey]] team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. [[The Patinoire Charlemagne]] is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic champions [[Marina Anissina]] and [[Gwendal Peizerat]]; and world champions [[Isabelle Delobel]] and [[Olivier Shoenfelder]] (both pairs competed in ice dancing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyon 2e : 60 ans de sport de glace|url=http://www.leprogres.fr/sortir/2015/05/26/lyon-2e-60-ans-de-sport-de-glace|website=leprogres.fr|publisher=Le Progres|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villeurbanne also has a basketball team, ASVEL, that plays at the [[Astroballe]] arena.

===Street art===
Since 2000, [[Birdy Kids]], a group of graffiti artists from the city, has decorated several random buildings and wall along the Lyon ring road. In 2012, the artist collective has been chosen to represent the city as its cultural ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdy Kids – cultural ambassador of Lyon|url=http://www.lyon.fr/evenement/exposition/birdy-kids.html|website=lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

[[File:Lyon - La Part-Dieu de nuit - 07-12-2009.jpg|left|thumb|[[La Part-Dieu]], the city's central business district]]
The GDP of Lyon is 62&amp;nbsp;billion euro,&lt;ref name=&quot;Economía&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opale-lyon.com/content/medias/pdf/000051.pdf|title=Chiffres-clés Lyon &amp; sa région|author=www.lyon-business.org|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city is the second richest after Paris. Lyon and its region [[Rhône-Alpes]] represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens concerning its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnerships to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Lyon|Chambre du commerce et d'industrie]], [[Urban Community of Lyon|Grand Lyon]]...). According to the ECER-Banque Populaire, Lyon is the 14th favorite city in the European Union concerning the creation of companies and investments{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. High-tech industries like biotechnology, software development, game design, and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to some of the most dangerous viruses in the world (class 4) in the Jean Merieux laboratory of research, like [[Ebola]], [[Marburg virus|Marburg]], [[Nipah virus|Nipah]], [[Hendra virus#Hendra virus|Hendra]], and [[Lassa virus|Lassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2009/06/05/le-laboratoire-p4-menagerie-virale_1202866_3244.html |title=Le laboratoire P4, ménagerie virale |work=Le Monde |location=France |date=|accessdate=8 July 2009}}{{Dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is the headquarters of many companies like [[Euronews]]; [[Lyon Airports]]; [[BioMérieux]]; [[Sanofi Pasteur]]; [[LCL S.A.]]; [[Boiron]]; [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]; [[Groupe SEB]]; [[Renault Trucks]]; [[Iveco Bus]]; LVL Medical, GL Events; [[Compagnie Nationale du Rhône]]; [[Norbert Dentressangle]] and intergovernmental agencies [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], [[Interpol]].
The specialization of some sectors of activities has the consequence of creating several main business centers:
[[La Part-Dieu]], located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after [[La Défense]] in Paris with over {{convert|1600000|m²|2|abbr=on}} of office space and services and more than 40,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandlyon.com/La-Part-Dieu.2315.0.html |title=Official site of Lyon |publisher=Grandlyon.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100424192931/http://www.grandlyon.com:80/La-Part-Dieu.2315.0.html |archivedate=24 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cité Internationale'', created by the architect [[Renzo Piano]] is located in the border of the [[Parc de la Tête d'Or]] in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of [[Interpol]] is located there. The district of ''Confluence'', in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.

Tourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5&amp;nbsp;million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the ''[[Festival of Lights (Lyon)|Fête des lumières]]'', the ''Nuits de Fourvière'' every summer, the ''Biennale d'art contemporain'' and the ''[[Nuits Sonores]]''.

==Demographics==
The population of the city of Lyon proper was 491,268 at the January 2011 census,&lt;ref name=&quot;commune&quot; /&gt; 14% of whom were born outside Metropolitan France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=8&amp;ref_id=19297|title=Le nouveau profil de la population active immigrée|work=http://www.insee.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Further2|[[Lyon Metro]], [[Tramways in Lyon]], [[Trolleybuses in Lyon]], [[Buses in Lyon]], [[Transport in Rhône-Alpes|Transports in Rhône-Alpes]] and [[TER Rhône Alpes]]}}

[[File:Lyon Autoroutes.svg|thumb|Network of highways around Lyon]]
[[Lyon–Saint Exupéry Airport]], located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is an important transport facility for the entire Rhône-Alpes region. Coach links connect the airport with other towns in the area including Chambéry and Grenoble. With its in-house train station ([[Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry]]), the airport is also connected to the [[TGV]] network. Since August 2010, the new [[Rhônexpress|Rhônexpress tram]] links the international airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes and can reach up to {{Convert|100|km/hour|mph|abbr=on}}; it offers connections with Underground A&amp;B, Tramway T1,T2 &amp; T3, and many bus lines. The [[Lyon-Bron Airport]] is a smaller airport dedicated to General Aviation (both private and commercial). Having helipads, the facility hosts a [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] and a [[Sécurité Civile]] (civilian defence) Base.

Lyon has two major railway stations: [[Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu|Lyon Part-Dieu]], which was built to accommodate the [[TGV]] and has become the principal railway station for extra-regional trains; and [[Gare de Lyon-Perrache|Lyon Perrache]], an older station that now serves primarily regional rail services. In practice, many trains, including TGVs, serve both stations. Smaller railway stations include [[Gare de Lyon-Gorge-de-Loup|Gorge-de-Loup]], [[Gare de Lyon-Vaise|Vaise]], [[Vénissieux]], [[Gare de Lyon-Saint-Paul|Saint-Paul]] and [[Gare de Lyon-Jean Macé|Jean Macé]]. Lyon is connected to the north ([[Lille]], [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], [[Rennes]], and in the future [[Amsterdam]]) and the south ([[Marseille]], [[Montpellier]], and in the future [[Barcelona]], [[Turin]]) by the TGV. Since 23 March 2012 there is also a direct TGV connection from [[Frankfurt]] via [[Strasbourg]] and Lyon to [[Marseille]]. It was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981.

The city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: [[A6 autoroute (France)|A6]] (to Paris); [[A7 autoroute|A7]] (to [[Marseille]]); [[A42 autoroute|A42]] (to [[Geneva|Geneve]]); and [[A43 autoroute|A43]] (to [[Grenoble]]). The city is now bypassed by the [[A46 autoroute|A46]]. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvière, connecting the [[A6 autoroute (France)|A6]] and the [[A7 autoroute|A7]] autoroutes, both forming the &quot;Autoroute du Soleil&quot;. Prior to the construction of the bypass by the east, the tunnel was famous for its traffic jams, since traffic between northern and southern France, as well as from neighboring countries and local traffic, converged at this point, Lyon being virtually the only low passage between the Alps and the Massif Central (extinct) volcano range.
Lyon is served by the [[Eurolines]] intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub that also includes tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service Vélo'v, and taxis.

[[File:Lyon - transports en commun - Farben nach Transportmittel.png|left|thumb|Public transport map]]
The [[Transports en commun lyonnais|TCL]] (for ''Transports en Commun Lyonnais''), Lyon's [[All-four (public transport)|all-four]] public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon agglomeration. The metro network has 4 lines ({{R-I|lyon|A}} {{R-I|lyon|B}} {{R-I|lyon|C}} {{R-I|lyon|D}}), 42 stations and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are 5 [[Tramways in Lyon|Lyon tram lines]] ({{Lyon Transport icon|T1}} {{Lyon Transport icon|T2}} {{Lyon Transport icon|T3}} {{Lyon Transport icon|T4}} {{Lyon Transport icon|T5}}) since April 2009: T1 from ''Debourg'' in the south to ''IUT-Feyssine'' in the north, Tram T2 from ''Perrache'' railway station in the southwest to [[Saint-Priest, Rhône|Saint-Priest]] in the southeast, Tram T3 from [[Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu|Part-Dieu]] to [[Meyzieu]], Tram T4 from 'Hôptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the South-East to Eurexpo in the South-East. The [[Buses in Lyon|Lyon bus network]] consists of the [[Trolleybuses in Lyon|Lyon trolleybus system]], [[motorbuses]], and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two [[Funiculars of Lyon|funicular lines]] from [[Vieux Lyon]] to Saint-Just and [[Fourvière]].

The ticketing system is quite simple right now, knowing that the city has only one operator for public transport; the SYTRAL (TCL is the brand name used for the transport, it stands for Transport en Commun Lyonnais (Lyon Common Transport)).

In 2008, an 'RER' ([[commuter rail]]) project was started, with the objective of linking Lyon with the surrounding cities which are growing fast. It should have a total of 8 lines and will replace the actual TER lines operated by the SNCF (National French Railway Network). It was planned to be fully finished by 2010.

The public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by ''[[Vélo'v]]'', a bicycle network providing a low-cost and convenient bicycle-hire service where bicycles can be hired and dropped off at any of 340 stations throughout the city of Lyon and Villeurbane, Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works exactly like the Velo'v but for cars.

==International relations==
* Lyon is a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]] '''[[Intercultural cities]]''' programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/Cities/lyon_en.asp |title=Intercultural city: Lyon, France |first=|last=[[Council of Europe]] |work=coe.int |year=2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martigny''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁtiɲi|lang}}; {{lang-de|Martinach}}; {{lang-la|Octodurum}};) is the capital of the French-speaking district of [[Martigny (district)|Martigny]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]] in [[Switzerland]]. It lies at an elevation of {{convert|471|m|ft|sp=us}}, and its population is approximately 15000 inhabitants (''Martignerains'' or &quot;Octoduriens&quot;). It is a junction of roads joining [[Italy]], [[France]] and Switzerland. One road links it over the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]] to [[Aosta]] (Italy), and the other over the [[col de la Forclaz]] to [[Chamonix]] (France). In winter, Martigny is appreciated for its numerous nearby Alp ski resorts such as [[Verbier]].

==Geography==
[[File:Martigny de la batiaz.jpg|thumb|left|Martigny in the Rhone valley]]
Martigny lies at an elevation of {{Convert|471|m|ft|sp=us}}, about {{Convert|33|km|mi|sp=us}} south-southeast of [[Montreux]]. It is on the east edge of the Rhône valley, at the foot of the Swiss Alps, and is located at the point where the southwestern-flowing Rhone turns ninety degrees northward and heads toward [[Lake Leman]] (Lake Geneva). The [[Dranse (Valais)|Dranse River]] flows from the [[Valais Alps]] into the Rhone here.

Martigny has an area, {{as of|2013|lc=on}}, of {{convert|24.97|km2|mi2|sp=us}}. Of this area, 31.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 39.8% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 23.3% is settled (buildings or roads) and 5.3% is unproductive land.&lt;ref name=SFSO/&gt;

In 1964 the current municipality was created with the merger of Martigny-Ville and Martigny-Bourg.&lt;ref name=Fusion&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office {{de icon}} accessed 19 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Martigny, ville romaine et moderne, vestiges de canalisations romaines.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of a Roman canal in Martigny]]
[[File:Chateau Batiaz.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Château de la Bâtiaz]]

The [[Gaulish]] name of the settlement in the 1st century BC was either ''Octodurus'' or  ''Octodurum'' (whence Martigny is  sometimes also called ''Octodure'' in French), an  [[oppidum]] or [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] of the [[Veragri]]. 
Octodurus was conquered by the Roman Empire in 57 BC, and occupied by [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (praetor 54 BC)|Servius Galba]] with the [[Legio XII Fulminata|twelfth legion]] and some [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] in order to protect the strategically important pass of Poeninus (now known as the  [[Great Saint Bernard Pass|Great St. Bernard]]), by which road the ''[[mercatores]]'' had used to travel at great risk as well as paying great tolls. (''B. G.'' iii. 1.)  Galba, after capturing many local strongholds and receiving the submission of the people, sent troops into the country of the [[Nantuates]], and with the his remaining army determined to winter in Octodurus.  Galba gave one part of the town to the  Gauls to winter in, and assigned the other to his troops. He fortified himself with a ditch and rampart, and thought he was safe. He was, however, suddenly attacked by the Gauls before his defences were complete or all his supplies were brought into the camp, resulting in the [[Battle of Octodurus]], and a very indecisive Roman victory;  the Romans estimated the Gaulish force at more than 30,000, and Caesar says that more than a third part were destroyed; nevertheless Galba, &quot;declining to try fortune to often&quot; (''B. G.'' iii. 6), burned the hamlet and retreated to the Province the next day.  Octodurus was later on joined to the [[Roman Empire]], as part of the [[Alpes Poeninae]] province. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (iii. c. 20) says that the Octodurenses received the ''[[Latinitas]]'' (''Latio donati'').  Octodurus declined over the following decades, and between AD 41 and 47 (during the reign of [[Claudius]]), a new Roman colony named  ''Forum Claudii Augusti'', later renamed 'to ''Forum Claudii Vallensium'',  was established nearby to take the role of capital of the  [[Vallis Poenina]] province. The town appears in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] and in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]. In the ''Notit. Prov.'', the place is called '''Civitas Vallensium Octodurus'''. At a later period it was called '''Forum Claudii Vallensium Octodurensium''', as an inscription shows.

An episcopal see was established here  in the 4th century (in the 6th century moved to [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]]), making the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion]] the oldest bishopric in what is now Switzerland. The first historically attested bishop of Octodurus was  Theodore/Theodolus (died in 391), who was present at the [[Council of Aquileia]] in 381.  A restored [[Roman amphitheatre]], temples, citizen living quarters, and [[thermal bath]]s can be seen in Martigny today. One authority speaks of the remains of a Roman aqueduct at Martigny. Many coins, and other memorials of the Roman time, have been found about the place.

There are no records of the town during the early medieval period. 
In the Middle Ages, the town took [[Martin of Tours]] as its patron saint, and became known by the German name ''Martinach'', recorded in Latinized form as  ''Martiniacum''  in 1018.
The church of Martigny, presumably at the site of the ancient cathedral, was consecrated to St. Mary in 1177, and to ''[[Our Lady of the Fields|Notre-Dame-des-Champs]]'' in 1420.
Martigny was placed under the protection of the [[House of Savoy]] in 1351, passing to [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice]] in 1475, as the seven tithings (''Sieben Zenden'') in treaty with the bishop of Sion and the canton of Berne seized all of the Lower Valais. 
The town was granted a degree of autonomy, its citizen being  allowed to elect their own local officials, known as the ''syndics'' (but no judges, as [[High, middle and low justice|justice]] lay with the bishopric until 1798).

The economy of Martigny was traditionally based on agriculture and [[viticulture]].  The town was often flooded by the Dranse, most severely in 1595 and in 1818.
From 1798 to 1802, Martigny was part of the Napoleonic [[Republic of Valais]], then in the [[Rhodanic Republic]], which passed to [[First French Empire|France]] from 1810 to 1814.
The Valais passed to Switzerland in 1815. 
In the 1840s, Martigny was the stage of a confrontation between the liberal-radical &quot;Young Switzerland&quot; and the conservative  &quot;Old Switzerland&quot; movements, culminating in the [[Battle at the Trient]] of 21 May 1844, taking place a few kilometers outside town.  The town was split into independent municipalities of ''Martigny-Ville'', ''Charrat'', ''Martigny-Bourg'' and ''Martigny-Combe'' in the 1830s. ''La Bâtiaz'' and ''Trient'' were further split off ''Martigny-Combe'' in  1845 and 1899, respectively. This administrative fragmentation of the town was reversed in the 20th century, with a fusion of   Martigny-Ville with  La Bâtiaz in 1956 and with Martigny-Bourg in 1964.

Martigny was connected to the Simplon railway in 1878, with a separate railway station   built in 1906. It was connected to the Swiss motorway system in 1981 with the completion of the Great-St-Bernhard exit of the A9.  Martigny had a population of 2,545 in 1850, of 3,550 in 1900 and of 5,915 in 1950.

===Culture and the Gianadda Museum===
The Romans left many archaeological remains in Martigny. The city is known for its [[amphitheater]], which was restored in 1978. [[Cow fighting|Cow fights]] are held in the amphitheater during early autumn for the &quot;Comptoir&quot;. The city is notable for its Pierre Gianadda Foundation (Fondation Pierre Gianadda) museum. This is the most important cultural attraction in Martigny and, in addition to the Gallo-Roman Museum, houses a car museum. The building was constructed around the remains of a former Roman temple built on top of Roman ruins. The foundation hosts three painting exhibitions every year, with works by renowned masters.

The Earth Science Museum (Musee des Sciences de la Terre)is another must-see museum in Martigny if you are interested in understanding the Alps better. Indeed, this museum presents a three-storey exhibition about geology in Valais, crystals from Valais and mines of Valais.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Martingy station.jpg|thumb|Martigny train station]]
Martigny is on the high speed Simplon line of the Swiss Federal Railway, SBB, which connects Italy (Domodossola) and southern Switzerland to northeastern Switzerland and the cities of Lausanne and Geneva. It also is the origin of narrow gauge railroads and bus routes that climb into the nearby mountains on both sides of the Rhone valley in which Martigny lies. One railroad goes west to Chamonix, France, crossing the border at Le Chatelard. The other railroad goes southeast to Chable and Orsieres. The regional transportation agency known as TMR SA (Transports de Martigny et Regions) operates this service and the ski trains known as the Mount-Blanc Express (to Chamonix) and the St. Bernard Express (to Orsieres). See the transportation map provided by the TMR website in the External Links section below. 
Thanks to Martigny's transport connections the winter sports regions of the &quot;4 Vallées&quot;, Portes-du-Soleil and Ovronnaz are easily reached.

It has been nearly one century that the two original railway companies Martigny-Orsières (MO) and Martigny-Châtelard (MC) began serving the valleys of Entremont and Trient. In 1990, the Boards of directors of MO and MC decided to combine for common management, however each company would maintain an independent status. Two new trains were started: the Saint-Bernard Express for the MO, and the Mont Blanc Express for the MC. Later the Octodure-Voyages and Orsières-Octodure-Transports companies were taken over. TMRSA is an important employer in the region with some 180 permanent staff.

The French holiday resort of Chamonix is accessible from Martigny in one-and-a-half hours using the scenic narrow-gauge tracks of the &quot;Mont Blanc Express&quot;. Crossing the wild Trient Gorge and ascending to breath-taking heights towards Chamonix (France), travelers will see waterfalls crashing down and majestic mountain crags rising in the background. Shady forests alternate with cozy villages and ultimately give way onto the grandiose glacier of Mont Blanc, Europe's highest peak.  The &quot;St Bernard Express&quot; takes passengers from Martigny to Orsières and from there by bus through beautiful mountain countryside to the hospice on the Great St. Bernard.  Pass through the Val d'Entremont to Orsières, from where a bus will take you to Champex-Lac, La Fouly or if it is summer (June to end of September) to the hospice on the Grand St. Bernard Pass. There are the legendary kennels where the dogs of the same name are bred, as well as the small local museum to view the Roman artifacts found here.

'''Ollon''' is a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] in the district of [[Aigle (district)|Aigle]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Vaud]] in [[Switzerland]], sited in the foothills of the mountains to the south-east of [[Lac Leman|the Lake of Geneva]].  The old German language name ''Olun'' is no longer used.

==History==
Ollon is first mentioned in 1018 as ''Aulonum'' though there is some debate about whether this refers to another settlement.  In 1025-32 it was mentioned as ''Olonum''.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Saint-Triphon===
The village of [[Saint-Triphon]] is situated on three hills overlooking the [[Rhone]] valley.  It was first mentioned in 1332 as ''Triphonis Sancti''.  Archeological finds include items from the Middle [[Neolithic]] to the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman]] era, including an Early [[Bronze Age]] [[necropolis]] and a Late Bronze Age smelter for copper processing.&lt;ref name=HDS_ST&gt;{{HDS|11345|Saint-Triphon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On the hill ''Le Lessus'' stands a {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high square tower, probably from the 13th Century.  The tower was partially destroyed in 1476.  Foundations indicate that the tower was reached by a walkway.  Nearby, the remains of a [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] chapel from the 12th Century is still visible.  In 1232 the Counts of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] granted the castle to Guy de Saillon.  The [[fief]] was dismembered in the 14th Century and reunited in the 16th Century under the Rovéréa family.   Between 1476-1798 it was one of the twelve ''Zenden des Mandements Ollon'' in the government of [[Aigle]].  The village was ruled by a [[Bern]]ese mayor.  Since the [[middle ages]], black marble has been mined in the village.&lt;ref name=HDS_ST/&gt;

'''Saint-Maurice''', or '''Saint-Maurice-en-Valais''', is a [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] and district capital of the district of [[Saint-Maurice (district)|Saint-Maurice]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]] in [[Switzerland]].  On 1 January 2013 the former municipality of [[Mex, Valais|Mex]] merged into the municipality of Saint-Maurice.&lt;ref name=Mutation&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{de icon}} accessed 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the site of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] outpost of [[Agaunum]] and the mediaeval [[St. Maurice's Abbey]], which has become a famous high school in Switzerland (''Collège de Saint-Maurice'').

Saint-Maurice is located at the entrance a pass leading to the upper part of the Rhône valley. As such, it has a strategic importance, and defence work were built from the 15th century to control this access. The [[Fortress Saint-Maurice]] was constructed in the surrounding mountainsides from 1880 through 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;litroz9&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moret|first=J.-C.|title=Le secteur central de St Maurice - Le concept|url=http://www.fortlitroz.ch/index.php?page=s48|publisher=Association Fort de Litroz|accessdate=5 January 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 010.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Saint Maurice|St. Maurice]], the town's namesake, depicted by [[Matthias Grünewald]], 15th century.]]
[[File:Stmaurice sprungli 1782.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Maurice castle and bridge in 1782]]
[[File:St-Maurice-Kapelle.jpg|thumb|left|The chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Scex was built in the 18th century on the remains of an 8th-century building]]
Saint-Maurice is first mentioned in 200 as ''Acaun[ensis] [quadragesimae] Gal[liarum]''.  In respect to [[Saint Maurice]], the name was changed from ''Acaunum'' ({{lang-fr|Agaune}}) to Saint-Maurice in 1003.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

Some traces of a [[Bronze Age]] settlement were found at the foot of the rocky spur in town.  There was a [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] town at Saint-Maurice, but very little is known about the actual layout of it.  There was a customs post at Acaunum, where an import and export tariff of 2.5% was levied.  The town probably had a shrine to water nymphs.  According to tradition, [[Saint Maurice]] and his southern Egyptian companions of the [[Theban Legion]] were martyred in Acaunum during the reign of [[Maximian]] (286-310).  Around 360-370 Theodul, the first [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of Valais, built a [[basilica]] in Acaunum in their honor.  The basilica became a popular pilgrimage site.  In 515, the [[List of Kings of Burgundy|King of Burgundy]] [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]] founded the Abbey, which he endowed with rich land.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In 523, the town was invaded by the [[Franks]], followed in 574 by the [[Lombards]] and in the mid-10th century, by the [[Saracens]].  In 888 [[Rudolph I of Burgundy|Rudolf]] of [[Elder House of Welf|Welf]] was crowned King of Burgundy in the Abbey.  In 1034, the entire [[Chablais]] region, which included Saint-Maurice, was acquired by the [[Duchy of Savoy]].  The towns of Saint-Maurice and [[Monthey]] formed a ''[[Vogt (Switzerland)|Kastlanei]]'' or district.  Around 1300, the ''Kastlan'' or [[vogt]] moved from Monthey to Saint-Maurice.  The abbot exercised dominion over the abbey and the town.  Citizens of the town were first mentioned in 1170 and by 1275, the citizens elected two mayors.  In the 13th century  the town was surrounded by walls.  Count Amadeus V of Savoy confirmed the city charter in 1317, at which time the town had a population of  between 1,400 and 1,800.  In 1475 the Lower Valais was ruled by the [[Seven Zenden]] as an associate member (Zugewandter Ort) of the [[Swiss Confederation]].  From 1475 until 1798, Saint-Maurice was the capital of the Saint-Maurice province.

In the following year, 1476, [[Bern]] began construction of a castle in the narrow Rhone valley at Saint-Maurice.  It was completed in 1646 with the expansion of the residential buildings.  However, in 1693 a devastating fire in the town, destroyed the warehouse of the castle and much of the [[gunpowder]] that was stored there.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

During the [[Helvetic Republic]] Saint-Maurice was a District capital.  After the [[Act of Mediation]] ended the Republic, from 1802-04 it was a Zenden capital and in 1810-14 it was the capital of a sub-prefecture of the [[First French Empire|French]] [[Simplon (department)|department of the Simplon]].  In 1822 the towns of Vérossaz and Evionnaz separated from the municipality.

[[File:Abbaye St-Maurice.jpg|thumb|Saint-Maurice Abbey]]
The most important religious institution in town was the abbey, but several other religious communities were established in Saint-Maurice.  These communities included; in 1611 the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], in 1865 the Sisters of Saint-Maurice, in 1906 the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] Sisters and in 1996 the Brotherhood of the [[Eucharist]] in Epinassey.  The Capuchin monastery's chapel was built in 1640.  The church of Saint-Sigismond has been the [[parish]] church since at least the mid-12th century.  It was built on the site of the 6th- or 7th-century St. John's burial church.  The present church building dates of 1715.  The still standing Hospice of Saint-Jacques was built in the 10th century.  Until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1529, Morcles belonged to the parish of Saint-Maurice and the church of Notre Dame-sous-le-Bourg was the [[parish church]] for [[Lavey, Switzerland|Lavey]].  In 1693 Notre Dame-sous-le-Bourg was destroyed in a fire and by 1721 only the ruins of the walls still remained.  The chapel of Saint-Laurent was first mentioned in 1178 and was abandoned in the 19th century.  The church of Notre-Dame-du-Scex was built in the 18th century, on the remains of an 8th-century building.   The Martyrs Chapel in Vérolliez was rebuilt to its present appearance in the 18th century.  The chapel in Epinassey was established in 1923. The Abbey College, was first mentioned in the [[Middle Ages]].  In 1806, support of the school was taken over by the canton and it became the ''Collège de Saint-Maurice''.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

[[File:Cindey 105rechts.jpg|thumb|{{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}} Cannon at the Cindey fort near Saint-Maurice]] 
The narrow canyon at Saint-Maurice facilitated both trade and defense.  The bridge over the Rhone was built around the 12th century and was the first bridge upstream of [[Lake Geneva]].  The fortifications in the canyon was gradually expanded in 1831, 1848, 1859 and finally in 1892.  During the Second World War, the fortifications at Saint-Maurice were one of the three main pillars of the [[National Redoubt (Switzerland)|National Redoubt]].  In 1995, the fortifications were abandoned and opened as a tourist attraction.  Following the army reforms of Armee 95 and XXI, the former mountain infantry military base of Saint-Maurice-Lavey has served as a training camp for the military police.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

A large rail yard was built in the municipality following the construction of a railway in 1860.  Between 1898 and 1940, the power plant Bois Noir, supplied the city of Lausanne with electricity.  However, the municipality was not industrialized until much later.  The first major industrial plant was a cement factory that was in operation from the 1950s until 1986.  In 1934 the Saint-Augustin printing house opened in town.  The newspaper &quot;valaisan Nouvelliste&quot; (New Valais) was founded in 1903 in Saint-Maurice.  It was renamed the &quot;Feuille d'Avis Nouvelliste et du Valais&quot; in 1968.  The &quot;Echos de Saint-Maurice&quot; was first published in 1899, and in 2000 became the &quot;Nouvelles  de l'Abbaye&quot;.  The &quot;La Patrie Valaisanne&quot; was published between 1927 and 1969.  It then became the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|CVP]] party newspaper under the title &quot;Valais Demain&quot; until it closed in 1997.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

The abbey building, its treasure, and the Feengrotte which opened in 1863, attract pilgrims and tourists.  The Saint-Amé clinic was founded in 1901 and was rebuilt in 1996 into the Lower Valais geriatrics center.  The city is home to a branch of the Mediathek Wallis (the library of Wallis), which was formerly the Lower Valais branch of the Cantonal Library.  The Educators' School of Wallis (Pädagogic Hochschule Wallis) is located in the municipality.  The new zoning plan of 1996 provides for the development of Saint-Maurice at the exit of the [[A9 motorway (Switzerland)|A9 motorway]].&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In 2008, the eleven-member town council had six members of the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|CVP]], four [[FDP.The Liberals]] and one representative of the ''Alliance de gauche''.  The thirty-member General Council had 15 members from the CVP, 11 from the FDP.The Liberals and four from the ''Alliance de gauche''.  The [[Bürgergemeinde|citizen's council]] is managed by a six-member committee, which oversee extensive property, including the campsite Bois Noir, pastures and forests.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

'''Sierre''' (German: ''Siders'') is the capital of the [[Districts of Switzerland|district]] of [[Sierre (district)|Sierre]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]] in Switzerland. It has a population of 16,332.

It is situated on the French–German language border of the canton of Valais. As a German-speaking [[minority language|minority]] lives in Sierre, it counts as one of the three official [[bilingual]] towns in Switzerland.

==History==
[[Image:Sierre in der abendsonne.jpg|thumb|left|Panoramic view of Sierre.]]
Sierre is first mentioned about 800 as ''Sidrium'', though a 12th-century document refers to the village being founded in 515.  In 1179 it was mentioned as ''Sirro'' and in 1393 as ''Syder''.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Prehistory===
The area around the modern town, especially Gerunden hill, was settled very early.  Archeological sites on Gerunden hill have produced [[neolithic]] objects and grave goods (including a polished stone ax), [[Bronze Age]] weapons and jewelry, Early [[Iron Age]] objects and [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] inscriptions, jars, jewelry and coins.  A [[soapstone]] pot from the [[Early Middle Ages]] and a gold signet ring with the name Graifarius from the 6th century have also been found.  Other sites on nearby hills and near the chapel of Saint-Ginier, the Château de Villa, the churches of Sainte-Croix, Grands-Prés, Muraz, Glarey and Bernunes have yielded up graves originating from the Bronze Age to the [[Carolingian]] era.  In Grands-Prés there is a fire pit from the beginning of the Late Iron Age (5th–6th century BC).&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

During the Roman era it appears that there was no major population center, but rather several scattered groupings of separate, upper class dwellings.  Under the chapel of  Saint-Ginier, the remains of a Roman era house or estate have been discovered.  Other Roman ruins have been found near the Château de Villa, in the church of Sainte-Croix (small terraced bath), in Grands-Prés by Muraz another house and in Gerunden the remains of buttress reinforced masonry indicate that a public or government building once stood there.  Five altars were found in Saint-Ginier, along with another two in the scattered settlements, one of which was dedicated to [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].  During the early imperial period, the ''duumvir'' or mayor of the ''Civitas Vallensium'', Caius Cominus Chiu, lived in Sierre.  In the late imperial period, the family of the senator of Vinelia Modestina also lived in the area.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

The chapel of Saint-Félix was built in the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century on Gerunden hill.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Medieval and early modern developments===
In 515 the estate at Sierre was given by the [[King of Burgundy]] [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]] to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice to hold as a [[fief]].  By the 11th century, the fief of Sierre was owned by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Bishop of Sion]].  The aristocratic families and the residents of the fief lived on the Gerunden, Vieux-Sierre and Plantzette hills.  On each of these hills there was a castle that served as the residence for the Bishop's representatives and as a refuge for the population.  The castles were razed in the mid-14th century when the noble families stood with the Bishop in his war with the Zenden of the Upper Valais and [[Counts of Savoy]].  The demolished castles and villages were abandoned and most residents settled farther north, in plan-Sierre.  The only castle that survived the wars of the 14th century was Goubing Castle, southeast of Sierre, which belonged to the lords of Granges.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

The Contrée of Sierre was originally a group the managed [[the commons]].  As vassals of the Bishop, they had the right to assemble twice a year to regulate the management of the common lands and the affairs of the local police.  In the 14th and 15th century this cooperative adopted a larger political role as they started to administer more of the daily affairs in the villages and acquired the right to appoint their own judges.  Eventually this grew into the Noble Contrée which then formed the core of Sierre Zenden from which the city of Sierre later developed.  The town of Plan-Sierre soon took over the leadership role in the Noble Contrée.  Until 1798, the Noble Contrée was appointed by a council of village representatives, under the leadership of the Bishop's representative.  In 1559, Plan-Sierre divided into four quarters Villa, Monderèche, La Salla and Glarey.  In 1620, the town hall was built.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===19th century===
As the capital of a Zenden, Sierre fought the French in the [[French invasion of Switzerland#Collapse|1798–99 invasion]].  In 1799, the city was occupied by French and [[Vaud]]ois troops.  The French set up their headquarters in Sierre.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In the conflicts between the conservative Upper Valais and the liberal Lower Valais, Sierre served as the seat of government in 1839–40.  After 1848, the villages of the Noble Contrée became municipalities under the Valais cantonal constitution.  The Zenden of Sierre became the District of Sierre with Sierre as the capital.  The new city executive council had nine members, while of the General Council (legislature) had 60.  Initially, the majority of the power was held by the Conservatives (now the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democrats]]).  In 1913, they were joined by the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland|Liberals]], in 1945 the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]] and in 2004 the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Greens]].

===Modern Sierre===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Sierre became economically important as very early [[aluminium smelting]] is enabled by its access to [[hydroelectricity]].  Today the aluminium industry Novelis and Alcan employs 1,200 workers in [[Chippis]] and Sierre.

In 2007, the agglomeration of Sierre/Crans-Montana was formed to address created to common problems, especially in the fields of tourism and transportation.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

==History==

===Prehistoric settlement===
[[File:Sion, la ville, nécropole du Petit-Chasseur.jpg|thumb|Necropolis at Le Petit-Chasseur]]
[[File:Sion, la ville la nécropole du Petit-Chasseur, menhirs.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Menhir]] at Le Petit-Chasseur]]
Sion is one of the most important pre-historic sites in Europe.  The [[alluvial fan]] of Sionne, the rocky slopes above the river and, to a lesser extent, Valeria and Tourbillon hills have been settled nearly continuously since antiquity.  The oldest trace of human settlement comes from 6200 BC during the late [[Mesolithic]].  Around 5800 BC early [[Neolithic]] farmers from the Mediterranean settled in Sion.  The settlements remained small until about 4500 BC, during the middle Neolithic, when the number of settlements increased sharply.  To support the population increase, farming and grazing spread throughout the valley.  They also began burying their dead in Chablandes-type stone burial [[cist]]s with engraved anthropomorphic [[stelae]].  The individual graves changed at the beginning of the third Millennium BC in large, dry stone wall communal tombs (such as the [[Dolmen]] of Le Petit-Chasseur).  During the [[Beaker culture]] period in the second half of the third Millennium, dolmens were built once again, but they were smaller and had no podium.  Stelae continued to be carved, though these were rich with geometric patterns and sometimes built out of old dolmen.  At the beginning of the Early [[Bronze Age]] (around 2300 BC) the last stelae were erected.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

The early settlements have been well documented.  There are huts from the middle Neolithic period found near Le Petit Chasseur and under Ritz Avenue.  Late Neolithic sites have been found at Bramois and the early Early Bronze Age site is at Le Petit Chasseur.  The Middle Bronze Age, however, is poorly documented.  From the subsequent epochs, the great [[necropolis]] of Don Bosco (the &quot;aristocrat&quot; tumulus of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age) and the necropolis of Sous-le-Scex from the [[La Tène culture]].&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Celtic and Roman town===
At the end of the first century BC, Sion was the capital of the [[Seduni]], one of the four [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes of the Valais.  [[Julius Caesar]] mentions them as ''Nantuates Sednnos Veragrosque''.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Sedu'ni|url=https://archive.org/stream/adictionarygree13smitgoog#page/n984/mode/2up/search/Sedunum|volume=2|pages=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were conquered by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] in the second decade BC.  By 8-7 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] praised the tribe (civitas) of Seduner with an inscription.   The town-hall is said to contain several Roman inscriptions, one of which found at Sion commemorates the Roman presence: ''Civitas Sedunorum Patrono''.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  Under the Romans it was known as ''Sedunum''.

The Roman settlement stretched mainly from what is now St. Theodul, between the Sionne and to the west side of the hill, Valeria.  Under the church, a large bath complex was discovered and partially excavated.  Near La Sitterie, Sous-le-Scex and in the upper part of the Avenue du Petit Chasseur, portions of several [[Roman villa|villae suburbana]] were found.  In the first Century AD, the Claudii Vallensium Forum, in what is now [[Martigny, Switzerland|Martigny]], became the capital of the civitas Vallensium.  Sedunum lost political importance, but still remained the home of many notable families.  Grave stelae attest to the presence of ''duumviri'' (magistrates of the civitas), of ''flamines'' (priest of the imperial cult), a Roman knight and a former consuls in the town.  In the 4th Century Praesides (provincial governors) are mentioned living in Sedunum, including a man named Pontius Asclepiodotus, who rebuilt an imperial building and, according to an inscription, converted to [[Christianity]] in 377.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Seat of a Catholic bishop===
[[File:Valais1300 english.png|thumb|Valais between 1260–1337.]]
The Roman Catholic [[Bishop of Sion|diocese of Sion]] is the oldest in Switzerland and one of the oldest north of the Alps.  At first the see was sited at Octodurum, now called Martigny/Martinach. The first authentically historical bishop was Saint Theodore/Theodolus (died in 391), who was present at the [[Council of Aquileia, 381|Council of Aquileia]] in 381. He founded the [[Agaunum|Abbey of Saint-Maurice]], with a small church in honor of [[Saint Maurice]], martyred there ca. 300, when he united the local hermits in a common life, thus beginning the Abbey of Saint-Maurice, the oldest north of the Alps. Theodore rebuilt the church at Sion, which had been destroyed by Emperor [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] at the beginning of the fourth century. At first the new diocese was a suffragan of the [[archdiocese of Vienne]]; later it became suffragan of Tarentaise.&lt;ref name=Lins&gt;{{cite book|last=Lins|first=Joseph|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14, Sion|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14014d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 589 the bishop, St. Heliodorus, transferred the see to Sion, leaving the low-lying, flood-prone site of Octodurum, where the [[Drance]] joins the [[Rhône]].  Though frequently the early bishops were also abbots of Saint-Maurice, the monastic community was jealously watchful that the bishops should not extend their jurisdiction over the abbey. Several of the bishops united both offices: [[Wilcharius]] (764-780), previously archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Vienne|Vienne]], whence he had been driven by the [[Al-Andalus|Moors]]; St. Alteus, who received from the pope a bull of exemption in favor of the monastery (780); Aimo II, son of Count [[Humbert I of Savoy|Humbert I]] of [[County of Savoy|Savoy]], who entertained [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] at Saint-Maurice in 1049.&lt;ref name=Lins/&gt;

The first cathedral is probably from the 6th Century.  It was halfway up the hill, where later the church of St. Peter stood, until the 19th Century when that church was demolished.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

The fortunes of the city grew when the bishop settled there.  In 999, King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rodolphe III]] of [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] granted the entire [[County of Valais]] to the Bishop, and Sion became the capital of this County.  The [[Prince-Bishop]] had the rights of [[High, middle and low justice|high and low justice]], the right to his own [[regalia]] and to appoint his own [[vassal]]s.  The residents of Sion were ruled by three appointees of the Bishop, the ''maior'', the ''vice dominus'' or ''Viztum'' and the ''salterus''.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===Medieval Sion===
[[File:Wappen 1594 BSB cod icon 326 016 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Hildebrand Riedmatten, Bishop of Sion in 1594]]
As a result of the decline of the [[feudal]] social order and thanks to privileges and concessions granted by the bishop, the citizens of Sion had a limited independence in the [[Middle Ages]].  A contract between Bishop Kuno and his ''maior'' William of Turn from 1179, is seen as the first step in the creation of an independent city government.  An agreement between the bishop, the [[collegiate church]] of St. Viztums and William of Turn in 1217 is the first written charter of freedom for the city.  It includes civil and criminal laws and punishments as well as trade and [[market right|market]] regulations.  In 1269, the [[citizen|burghers]] of the town had their own council with its own statutes.  The council governed the use and management of [[the commons|the common lands]] through twelve councilors led by the ''Viztum''.  These administrators later became [[syndic]]s and were known by this title in 1323.  In 1338, the [[vicar general]] confirmed the existing rights and freedom of the citizens of Sion in a document.  The document was renewed by the bishop in 1339 and was presented to each successive bishop to re-confirm after his election.  In the same year, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] raised Sion to a [[free imperial city]] and collected the surrounding lands into a [[barony]].  In 1346, the episcopal Viztum and the citizenry collectively wrote the police regulations.  Sion was now a city with city walls, documented freedoms and the market right.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

===From the late middle ages to the end of the ancien regime===
[[File:Braun Sion UBHD.jpg|thumb|Sion in 1572, from ''Beschreibung vnd Contrafactur der vornembster Stät der Welt'', Köln 1582]]
[[File:Merian Sitten.jpg|thumb|Sion in 1640, from ''Topographia Helvetiae, Rhaetiae et Valesiae, 1642'']]
From the middle of the 14th Century to 1475, the history of Sion was filled with wars and destruction.  Bishop Witschard Tavel tried to reduce the privileges of the cathedral collegiate chapter and the citizenry with the support of the [[Count of Savoy]].  In 1352, Sion was conquered, pillaged and plundered by an army from Savoy.  In 1373, the Bishop bought back the majority of the fief of Sion from the de Greysier family.  [[Majorie Castle]] became the Bishop's residence and the ''maior'' was now appointed by the Bishop every year.  Sion was attacked and looted in 1384, again during the [[Raron affair]] in 1418 and finally in 1475 during the [[Burgundian Wars]].&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

During this period, the citizenry strove to defend their acquired privileges and whenever possible to expand those rights.  In 1414, the city council approved a new set of statutes for the citizens.  In 1433, Bishop Andreas dei Benzi approved a strict set of regulations concerning the granting of citizenship rights to applicants.  Two years later, in 1435, he allowed the city council to appoint the Bishop's representative to Sion.  He retained only the right to approve or reject the council's choice.  In 1560, the citizenry bought the office of ''Viztum'' from the feudal landholder, the de Chevron family.  A year earlier the bishop assigned the office of ''salterus'' to the citizenry.  So by the mid 16th Century, the city enjoyed a nearly total autonomy.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In the 16th Century, due to a strong immigration from the German-speaking Upper Valais, Sion became almost totally Germanized.  The town council minutes were written in Latin until 1540, when they changed to German.  Official invoices changed to German in 1600.

The 17th and 18th Centuries were a peaceful time in Sion.  The new city hall was built on Grand-Pont between 1657-65.  In 1788, a fire broke out in the city.  It damaged Majoria and Tourbillon castles and destroyed 115 of the 284 inhabited houses.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In the [[High Middle Ages]], the residents of Sion were ''homines episcopi'' or people of the bishop.  This was true both for the staff at the court as well as the serfs who tilled the land, and the craftsmen and traders.  As the [[Bürgergemeinde|civic community]] gradually began to organize, they were no longer willing to automatically grant every new arrival the same rights as citizens.  Those who were unwilling or unable to purchase citizenship, which cost about 60 shillings in 1326, but wished to live in Sion were classed as permanent residents and their descendants held the same status until they could buy their citizenship.  The permanent residents were mainly workers, craftsmen (often  originating from the Swiss Confederation and the Germanies) and traders (mostly from Savoy and northern Italy).  An outbreak of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1348 wiped out many citizens.  In addition to the citizen's deaths, the restrictive attitude of the citizenry toward new members led to citizens becoming a minority in Sion.  In the first population census in 1610 the town had 1,835 inhabitants, of whom 412 were citizens and 1,423 were permanent residents.  In the 18th Century, a third category, the tollerati, was added.  On the eve of the revolution the city's population was 19% citizen, 30% permanent resident and 51% tollerati and other marginalized groups.  There were only 41 citizen families, of which twelve were nobility and nine belonged to the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] class.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

Starting in 13th Century and in the first half of the 14th Century, long distance trade began to pick up from northern Italy via the [[Simplon Pass]] and through the Valais into the Champagne region.  Sion became an important relay station on this route.  The station at Sion included a ''Sust'' or warehouse that also provided additional animals to help haul wagons over the pass.  Many local nobles and farmers were involved in animal husbandry to support the Sust and pastured their animals, during the summer, in pastures on the other side of the Rhône.  The Sust's barns are stables were still in operation until the 19th Century.  Along the Sionne river, there were mills, saw mills and other industries that needed water power.  In addition there were many tanneries in the same area.  In 1466, the smiths, bricklayers and stonemasons' guilds arose from an ecclesiastical fraternity.  Those three guilds were followed by the butchers' guild  in 1512, the bakers' guild in 1525, the tailors and drapers' guild in 1527 and in 1602 the guild of shoemakers and tanners. These guilds played a major economic role in Sion until the end of the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien Régime]].  The Inn of the White Cross opened in 1550 for merchants and wealthy travelers, followed in 1688 by the inn of the Golden Lion, which was built beside the town hall.

Very little is known about the early churches in Sion since written sources are meager before the 12th Century.  The predecessor of the present cathedral, the church of Notre-Dame-du Glarier in the Palacio district served both as the bishop's church and the [[parish church]] in the 12th Century.  It was destroyed in the 14th Century during one of the wars between the Bishop of [[Bishopric of Sion|Sion]] and the [[House of Savoy]].  It was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th Century.  In the meantime, St. Peter's church took over as the bishop's and parish church.  It was demolished in 1806.  The Valeria Church was built in the 11th Century and originally consecrated to St. Catherine.  This church was probably the first church for the [[cathedral chapter]].  St. Theoduls church was first mentioned in the 13th Century.  It was probably built in 1100 on the ruins of Roman baths and a [[Carolingian]] era church.  This church was probably built as a grave and pilgrimage church with a shrine in the Theodulskrypta.  It was destroyed in the wars with the House of Savoy in the 14th Century.  Construction began on a new church in 1510-16 under Bishop Matthew Schiner and continued until the 17th Century.  St. Theoduls served the French-speaking urban population as a parish church until 1798.  In the 17th Century, citizens claimed the  right to choose their parish priest, over objections of the ecclesiastical authorities.  The dispute eventually required mediation through the [[Papal Nuncio]].  The resolution allowed the citizens to choose the pastor from one of four proposed by the archbishop.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt;

In the second half of the 16th Century a large [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] community grew in Sion under the leadership of renowned [[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]s, who had learned of the new doctrine while students in Bern, Basel, Zürich, Lausanne or Geneva.  After 1604, the Valais government had clearly decided to remain part of the old faith.  Some individuals or families emigrated to reformed areas, while others went back to the old faith. The [[Counter-Reformation]], led by the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]] of Savoy and the [[Jesuits]] destroyed the last hopes of the Protestants to establish a foothold in the cathedral town.  The Capuchins founded a monastery in 1631 and started construction of the monastery church in 1636) and the Jesuits started missionary activity in the 17th century and established a school in 1734.

===From the Helvetic Republic to 1848===
During the anti-patrician unrest in the Lower Valais at the end of the 18th Century, Sion remained a bastion of the aristocracy.  The leaders of the Les Crochets conspiracy were executed in 1791 in Sion to avoid riots.  After the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] on 5 March 1798, Sion was caught between the revolutionary spirit of a portion of its population (who established a [[liberty pole]] in town on 10 March) and conservative elements who wanted to prevent any change in the Valais.  Following the creation of the [[Helvetic Republic]] in May 1789, a counter-revolutionary rebellion erupted in the upper Valais.  This short-lived rebellion was crushed on 17 May by French and [[Vaud]]ois troops and Sion was plundered.

Under the Helvetic Republic, Sion was source of conflict between supporters and opponents of the new regime.  In May 1799 counter revolutionary forces from Upper Valais looted the city again.  In order to ensure peace in the Valais, the French General [[Louis Marie Turreau]] de Garambouville occupied Sion in 1801 and in 1802 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] declared the independent [[Rhodanic Republic]].  It then remained independent until 1810 when it was annexed into France as the [[Simplon (department)|département of Simplon]].  Between 1798 and 1801 the representative of the Helvetic government resided in Sion.  Under the French occupation, Joseph du Fay de Lavallaz was appointed by the emperor to be the mayor of the district of Sion.

After Napoleons defeats during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] the Valais was occupied by [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] at the end of December 1813.  Under the Austrians, the citizenry received many of their rights back.  During the following year, the government was split between supporters of the Ancien Régime and the supporters of the independent republic, with each party forming a council.  When the two councils combined, the number of Council members was set to 20.  Between 1815 and 1839, the patrician class gradually took more and more of the rights and duties of the citizenry back on themselves, gaining more and more power.  In response to this, Alexandre de Torrente founded a liberal party in 1830.  In the cantonal government, Sion agreed most often with the German-speaking Upper Valais.  Which gave the Upper Valais a majority of the Zenden in the council, to the detriment of the French-speaking Lower Valais.  However, after the vote on the constitution of 1839, the Upper Valais broke away from the rest of the canton.  Sion was chosen as the capital of the Valais, while the breakaway Upper Valais chose [[Sierre]].  In 1840, the Upper and Lower Valais were reunited.  But four years later, Sion was occupied by Upper Valais troops during the beginning of the [[Sonderbund War]].  Federal troops occupied Sion in November 1847.

===Modern Sion===
Sion lost to [[Turin]], [[Italy]] in its bid to host the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. Sion also bid for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], which it lost to [[Salt Lake City]], and the [[1976 Winter Olympics]], which it lost to [[Denver]] (the games were reassigned to [[Innsbruck]] when Denver residents voted down additional funding).

Situated where the [[Rhône]] exits [[Lake Geneva]], it is the capital of the [[Canton of Geneva|Republic and Canton of Geneva]].

The municipality ''(ville de Genève)'' has a population ({{as of|{{Swiss populations YM|CH-GE}}|lc=on}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-GE|6621}}, and the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] (which is essentially the city and its inner-ring suburbs) has {{Swiss populations|CH-GE|CH-GE}} residents.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-GE}} In 2011, the compact ''agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise ''(''Greater Geneva ''or'' Grand Genève'') had 915,000 inhabitants in both – Switzerland and France (&lt; 30mins distance). Within Swiss territory, the commuter area named &quot;''Métropole lémanique''&quot; contains a population of 1.25 million. This area is essentially spread east from Geneva towards the Riviera area ([[Vevey]], [[Montreux]]) and north-east towards [[Yverdon-les-Bains]], in the neighbouring canton of [[Vaud]].

Geneva is a [[global city]], a financial center, and worldwide center for [[diplomacy]] due to the presence of numerous [[international organization]]s, including the headquarters of many of the agencies of the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Hofmann|title= Staying on the Safe Side; Geneva|work=[[The New York Times Company]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE133EF937A15755C0A966958260&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=Canton+of+Geneva&amp;st=nyt|date=24 June 1990|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Finn-Olaf Jones|title=36 Hours in Geneva|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/travel/16hours.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Geneva+Switzerland&amp;st=nyt|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geneva is the city that hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;François Modoux, &quot;La Suisse engagera 300 millions pour rénover le Palais des Nations&quot;, ''[[Le Temps]]'', Friday 28 June 2013, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the place where the [[Geneva Conventions]] were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and [[prisoners of war]].

== Toponym ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
The city was mentioned in [[Latin]] texts, by [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Caesar]], with the spelling ''Genava'', probably from a [[Continental Celtic|Celtic]] toponym ''*genawa-'' from the stem ''*genu-'' (&quot;bend, knee&quot;), in the sense of a bending river or [[estuary]].

The medieval [[county of Geneva]] in [[Middle Latin]] was known as '' pagus major Genevensis'' or ''Comitatus Genevensis'' (also ''Gebennensis''), after 1400 becoming the ''[[Genevois (province)|Genevois]]'' province  of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the [[John Calvin|Reformation]] the seat of the [[bishop of Geneva]]).

The name takes various forms in modern languages, ''Geneva'' {{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɨ|ˈ|n|iː|v|ə}} in English, {{lang-fr|Genève}} {{IPA-fr|ʒ(ə)nɛv|}},&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Word Reference]]''': [http://www.wordreference.com/fren/Gen%C3%A8ve Genève].{{unreliable source?|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Genf}}  {{IPA-de|ˈɡɛnf||de-Genf.ogg}}, {{lang-it|Ginevra}} {{IPA-it|dʒiˈneːvra|}}, and {{lang-rm|Genevra}}.

The city in origin shares its name, ''*genawa'' &quot;estuary&quot;, with the Italian port city of [[Genoa]] (in Italian ''Genova'').

[[File:DV307 no.80 From Vile Rousean, Geneva Aug 4 1858.png|thumb|left|A view of Geneva by [[Frances Elizabeth Wynne]], August 4, 1858]]
[[File:Escalade-battle-2.jpg|thumb|[[L'Escalade]], the failed surprise-attack (12 December 1602) made by troops sent by [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], to take Geneva]]Geneva was an [[Allobroges|Allobrogian]] border town, fortified against the Celtic tribe [[Helvetii]], when the Romans took it in 121 BC. It  [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|became Christian]] under the Late [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], and acquired its first [[bishop of Geneva|bishop]] in the 5th century, having been connected to the [[bishopric of Vienne]] in the 4th.
In the [[Middle Ages]], Geneva was ruled by a [[county of Geneva|count]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time the [[House of Savoy]] came to (at least nominally) dominate the city. In the 15th century, an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]]an government emerged with the creation of the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]]. In the first half of the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] reached the city, causing religious strife during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself  with  the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. 
In 1541, with Protestantism in the ascendancy, [[John Calvin]], the founder of [[Calvinism]], became the spiritual leader of the city. By the 18th century, however, Geneva had come under the influence of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[France]], which cultivated the city as its own, who tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk – to the point that an abortive revolution took place in 1782. In 1798, revolutionary France under the [[French Directory|Directory]] annexed Geneva. At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the [[Swiss Confederation]]. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Geneva|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552135/Geneva_(Switzerland).html#s3|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029012940/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552135/Geneva_(Switzerland).html|archivedate=29 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==

===Topography===
[[File:Geneva SPOT 1124.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Geneva seen from SPOT Satellite]]
Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of [[Lake Geneva]], where the lake flows back into the [[Rhône]]. It is surrounded by two mountain chains, the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] and the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]].

[[File:Genève vue du Salève.jpg|thumb|left|The Geneva area seen from the Salève in France. The Jura mountains can be seen on the horizon.]]
The city has an area of {{convert|15.93|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, while the area of the [[Canton of Geneva|canton]] is {{convert|282|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, including the two small [[enclave|exclave]]s of [[Céligny]] in [[Vaud]]. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of {{convert|38|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is sometimes referred to as ''Petit lac'' (small lake). The canton has only a {{convert|4.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long border with the rest of Switzerland. Of {{convert|107.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} of border, 103 are shared with France, the [[Ain|Départment de l'Ain]] to the north and east and the [[Haute-Savoie|Département de la Haute-Savoie]] to the south and west.

Of the land in the city, {{convert|0.24|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 1.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|0.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 3.1% is forested.   Of the rest of the land, {{convert|14.63|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 91.8% is settled (buildings or roads), {{convert|0.49|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 3.1% is either rivers or lakes and {{convert|0.02|km2|acre|abbr=on}} or 0.1% is unproductive land.&lt;ref name=BFS_land&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/data/gemeindedaten.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics] 2009 data {{de icon}} accessed 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4% of the area while housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%.  All the forested land area is covered with heavy forests.  Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops.  Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is in lakes and 2.9% is in rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=BFS_land/&gt;
[[File:Confluence Rhône et Arve.JPG|thumb|Confluence of the Rhône and the Arve]]
The altitude of Geneva is {{convert|373.6|m|ft|1}}, and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the [[Pierres du Niton]], two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]]. This rock was chosen by General [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]] as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swisstopo]], [http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/basics/geo/faq/horizon Height reference for Switzerland]. Retrieved 1 February 2007. {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/basics/geo/faq/horizon|date =20070927211213|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second main river of Geneva is the [[Arve]] which flows into the [[Rhône]] just west of the city centre. [[Mont Blanc]] can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city centre.

The climate of Geneva is [[temperate climate|temperate]], [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are pleasantly warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than the other seasons. Ice storms near [[Lac Léman]] are quite normal in the winter. In the summer many people enjoy swimming in the lake, and frequently patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the [[Bains des Pâquis]]. Geneva, in certain years, receives snow in the colder months of the year. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as [[Verbier]] and [[Crans-Montana]] are just over two hours away by car. [[Saleve|Mont Salève]] (1400 m), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre. The famous [[Mont Blanc]] is visible from most of the city, enclosed in the mountain alp range surrounding nearby [[Chamonix]], which is one of the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva. There are a number of other Northern Alps ski resorts that are easily accessible from Geneva Airport including those of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon and Flaine as well as Le Grand Bornand and La Clusaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ski Resorts Near Geneva Airport {{!}} Ski Geneva|url = http://skigeneva.co.uk/ski-resorts-near-geneva-airport|website = Ski Geneva|access-date = 2016-01-27|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11&amp;nbsp;°C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was {{convert|39.7|C|F}} in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was -20.0&amp;nbsp;°C (-4.0&amp;nbsp;°F) in February 1956.

[[File:Geneva city insignia.gif|thumb|Logo of the city of Geneva]]
The City Council ('''Conseil administratif''') constitutes the [[executive (government)|executive]] government of the City of Geneva and operates as a [[collegiate authority]]. It is composed of five councilors ({{lang-fr|Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative}}), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as [[mayor]] (''maire''). In the governmental year 2015/2016 the City Council  is presided by ''Madame la maire de Genève'' [[Esther Alder]]. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Parliament are carried by the City Council. The election of the City Council is held every five years. The current mandate period (''la législature'') is from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2020. The executive body holds its meetings in the [[Palais Eynard]], near the Parc des Bastions. The building was built between 1817 and 1821 in Neoclassical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ville-geneve.ch/conseil-administratif/ |title=Le Conseil administratif 2015-2020 |publisher=Ville de Genève |type=official site |date=2 June 2015 |language=French |location=Geneva, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
The {{as of|2000|alt=2000 census}} documented that 66,491 residents, or 37.4% of the population were Roman Catholic, while 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]], and 8,698 (4.89%) were [[Muslim]]. Of the rest of the population, there were 3,959 [[Orthodox Christianity|members of an Orthodox church]] (2.22%), there were 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]], and there were 2,422 individuals (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 2,601 individuals (1.46%) who were [[Judaism|Jewish]]. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 individuals who were Hindu and 423 individuals who belonged to another church. A total of 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church, were [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[Atheism|atheist]], and 26,575 individuals (14.93%) did not answer the question.&lt;ref name=STAT2000/&gt; The headquarters of the [[Raelian movement]] are located within the city.

Geneva has historically been considered a [[Protestant]] city and was known as the ''Protestant Rome'' due to its being the base of [[John Calvin]], [[William Farel]], and other [[Protestant Reformers|reformers]]. Over the past century, substantial immigration from [[France]] and other predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] countries, as well as general [[Post-Christian Europe|European secularization]], has changed Geneva's religious demography considerably. As a result, twice as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Catholics form part of the  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]].

Prior to the Reformation the city was officially Catholic. It almost certain that St. Isaac (c. 400) was the first bishop of Geneva, one of his first successors being  [[Salonius|St. Salonius]], who took part in the  [[Council of Orange (441)]],  and in those of  [[Vaison-la-Romaine|Vaison]] (442) and [[Archbishopric of Arles|Arles]] (about 455). In the Middle Ages the bishops of Geneva had the status of [[prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] from 1154, but the territory was subject to the political ambitions of the counts of Geneva and later the counts (subsequently dukes) of Savoy. Politically the city protected itself by union with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (''[[Eidgenossenschaft]]''), uniting itself in 1526 with Berne and Fribourg.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy-LausanneGeneva&quot;&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia: Lausanne and Geneva''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=No citation given|date=July 2015}}
As highlighted by popular perception, the [[Protestant Reformation]] caused major transformations in the religious and political life of Geneva. Berne favoured the introduction of the new teaching, but in 1531 Catholic Fribourg renounced its allegiance to Geneva. Although  [[John Calvin]] went to Geneva in 1536, already from  1532 the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile and in 1535 he fixed his see at [[Annecy]], in 1536 at [[Gex, Ain|Gex]]. The city became a stronghold of [[Calvinism]].

The most famous bishop of Geneva at this period is [[St. Francis de Sales]], bishop in the years 1602–21.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy-LausanneGeneva&quot; /&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=No citation given|date=July 2015}}

In 1802, during its annexation to France under [[Napoleon I]], the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 [[Treaty of Turin]] stipulated that  in territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva the Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without agreement with the Holy See.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy-LausanneGeneva&quot; /&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=No citation given|date=July 2015}}  In 1819 the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by [[Pope Pius VII]] and in  1822 the non-Swiss territory was made into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Annecy|Diocese of Annecy]]. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the [[separation of church and state]], enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy-LausanneGeneva&quot; /&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=No citation given|date=July 2015}}

The [[World Council of Churches]] has its headquarters at the [[Ecumenical Centre]] in [[Grand-Saconnex]], Geneva.

===Crime===

== Society and culture ==

=== Media ===
The city's main newspaper is the ''[[Tribune de Genève]]'', with a readership of about 187,000, a [[Newspaper|daily newspaper]] founded on 1 February 1879 by [[James T. Bates]].
''[[Le Courrier]]'', founded in 1868, was originally supported by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but has been independent since 1996. Mainly focussed on Geneva, ''Le Courrier'' is trying to expand into other cantons in [[Romandy]]. Both ''[[Le Temps]]'' (headquartered in Geneva) and ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of [[Romandy]].

Geneva is the main media centre for French-speaking Switzerland.  It is the headquarters for the numerous [[French language]] [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]] networks of the [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation]], known collectively as [[Radio Télévision Suisse]].  While both networks cover the whole of [[Romandy]], special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies in the case of special events such as elections. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM ([[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.8&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[Radio Cité]] (Non-commercial radio, FM 92.2&amp;nbsp;MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0&amp;nbsp;MHz, also broadcast in [[Vaud]]), and [[World Radio Switzerland]] (FM 88.4&amp;nbsp;MHz).

Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many of the [[List of television stations in France|French television channels]] are also available.

=== Traditions and customs ===
Geneva observes ''[[Jeûne genevois]]'' on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September.  By local tradition, this commemorates the date the news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Huguenots reached Geneva.

Geneva celebrates ''[[L'Escalade]]'' on the weekend nearest 12 December celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack by troops sent by [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]] during the night of 11&amp;ndash;12 December 1602. Besides festive traditions that includes chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour, Geneva has been organizing 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been very popular amongst racers across all ages. Non-competitive racers have fun by dressing up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race. 2015 marks the 38th edition of this race.

Since 1818, a particular [[chestnut|chestnut tree]] has been used as the official &quot;herald of the spring&quot; in Geneva. The ''sautier'' (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal [[News release|press release]] and the local newspaper will usually mention the news. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud appears earlier and earlier in the year. During the first century, many dates were in March or April. In recent years, it has usually been in mid-February and sometimes even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve.ch/fao/2006/20060814.asp |title=La Une de la FAO no 93 année 253 : FAO: La Treille, promenade et lieu d'observation climatique |publisher=Geneve.ch |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, which was one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, became a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared very early, on 19 February.

=== Music and festivals ===
The [[opera house]], the [[Grand Théâtre de Genève]], which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The [[Victoria Hall (Geneva)|Victoria Hall]] is used for classical music concerts. It is home of the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]].

Every summer, the [[Fêtes de Genève]] (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to the [[Radio télévision suisse]], in 2013, hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual one-hour long grand [[fireworks|firework]] display of the [[Fêtes de Genève]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rts.ch&quot;&gt;[http://www.rts.ch/info/regions/geneve/5125297-une-heure-de-feux-genevois-sur-le-theme-des-conquetes.html &quot;Une heure de feux genevois sur le thème des conquêtes&quot;], [[Radio télévision suisse|www.rts.ch]] (page visited on 11 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museums ===
Museums and art galleries are numerous throughout the city. Some are related to the many international organizations as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum]] or the [[Microcosm (CERN)|Microcosm]] in the CERN area. The [[Palace of Nations]], home of the United Nations headquarters, can also be visited.

== Education ==
[[File:university Geneva.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Geneva]].]]
Geneva is home to the [[University of Geneva]]. In 1559, [[John Calvin]] founded the [[Geneva Academy]], a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century, the Academy  lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011, the ranking web of universities ranked it {{ordinal|35}} European university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carrentalgenevaairport.net/the-complete-list-the-top-100-global-universities/ |title=The Top 100 Global Universities |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] was among the first academic institutions to teach international relations in the world and is today one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies.

Also, the oldest [[international school]] in the world is located in Geneva, the [[International School of Geneva]], founded in 1924 along with the [[League of Nations]].

The [[Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations]] is a [[private university]] on the grounds of the Château de Penthes, an old manor with a park and view of [[Lake Geneva]].

The Canton of Geneva's public school system has ''écoles primaires'' (ages 4–12) and  ''cycles d'orientation'' (ages 12–15). The obligation to attend school ends at age 15, but secondary education is provided by  ''collèges'' (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the [[Collège Calvin]], which could be considered one of the oldest [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;rts.ch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Collège de Genève au Collège Calvin (historique)|language=French|publisher=Geneva Education Department|url=http://wwwedu.ge.ch/po/calvin/histoire_college.htm|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''écoles de culture générale'' (15-18/19)  and the ''écoles professionnelles'' (15-18/19). The ''écoles professionnelles'' offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship.  Geneva also has a choice of private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Introduction to the Geneva Association of Private Schools |publisher= Geneva Association of Private Schools |url= http://www.agep.ch/eng/agep_presentation2.php |accessdate= 4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
Among the most popular sports in Switzerland is [[ice hockey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/|title= Popular sports in Switzerland | publisher=popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info | accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geneva is the home of the [[Genève-Servette HC]], who play in the Swiss [[National League A]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transports Publics Genevois}}
[[File:Gare de Geneve 2236 Michelides.jpg|thumb|The Railway Station of Geneva]]
[[File:TCMC (Tramway Cornavin - Meyrin - CERN).JPG|thumb|TCMC (Tramway Cornavin - Meyrin - CERN)]]
The city is served by the [[Geneva Cointrin International Airport]]. It is connected by [[Geneva Airport railway station]] ({{lang-fr|Gare de Genève-Aéroport}}) with both the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] network and the French [[SNCF]] network, including to Paris, Lyon, [[Marseille]] and [[Montpellier]] by [[TGV]]. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland ([[A1 (Switzerland)|A1 motorway]]) and France.

Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by ''[[Transports Publics Genevois]]'' (TPG). In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network covers most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines extending into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the [[Mouettes Genevoises]], which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the ''[[Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman]]'' (CGN) which serves more distant destinations such as [[Nyon]], [[Yvoire]], [[Thonon-les-Bains|Thonon]], [[Évian-les-Bains|Évian]], [[Lausanne]] and [[Montreux]] using both modern diesel vessels and vintage [[paddle steamers]].

[[File:Train Station Geneva 2006 808.JPG|thumb|left|200px| Geneva Sécheron train station]]
Trains operated by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] connect the airport to the main station of [[Gare de Cornavin|Cornavin]] in six minutes, and carry on to towns such as Nyon, Lausanne, Fribourg, Montreux, Neuchâtel, Bern, Sion and Sierre. Regional train services are being increasingly developed, towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits, two new stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the [[Botanical garden|Botanical Gardens]]) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.

In 2011, work started on the CEVA (Cornavin – [[Eaux-Vives]] – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives station and [[Annemasse]], in France. The link between the main station and the [[classification yard]] of La Praille already exists; from there, the line will go mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it will link to the existing line to France. Support for this project was obtained from all parties in the local parliament.

The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric “flash” recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking. By December 2016, the TOSA buses will run on line 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdg.ch/geneve/circulation-en-ville/ici-trois-ans-bus-tosa-rouleront-ligne-23/story/29820398|title=D’ici trois ans, les bus TOSA rouleront sur la ligne 23 (French)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of [[Infant car seat|seating]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20min.ch/ro/rechercher/story/27606758|title=20 Minutes: Bebés et enfants ne sont pas bienvenus dans les taxis (French)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars has been approved in principle by the Geneva cantonal authorities, and is projected to be implemented over four years (2010–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldradio.ch/wrs/news/switzerland/greenlight-for-a-car-free-geneva.shtml |title=worldradio.ch |publisher=worldradio.ch |date= |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utilities ===
Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the [[municipalities of the Canton of Geneva]] by the state-owned [[Services Industriels de Genève]] (shortly SIG). Most of the drinkable water (80%) is extracted from the [[Lake Geneva|lake]]; the remaining 20% is provided by [[groundwater]] originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams on the [[Rhône]] (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is made from the heat induced by the burning of waste at the [[Waste management#Incineration|waste incineration facility]] of [[Les Cheneviers]]. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by [[renewable energy|renewable methods]], and in particular does not use electricity produced using [[nuclear reactor]]s or [[fossil fuels]].
Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, [[service provider]]s and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, &quot;Voisin, voisine&quot; a [[FTTH|Fibre to the Home]] pilot project with a [[Triple play (telecommunications)|Triple play]] offering was launched to test the [[end-user]] market in the Charmilles district.
